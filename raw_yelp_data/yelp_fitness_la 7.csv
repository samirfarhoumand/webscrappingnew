I've been a member there for over 3 years now and I don't remember ever having anything to complain about. Staff is amazing, very helpful (Kren and Angle especially were very helpful) and always smiling, not like those jerks at other gyms nearby. classes are wonderful and now they have a limit of people who can attend the class so it is never crowded. Locker rooms and toilets are always kept EXTREMELY clean. I always see people cleaning. Members RE-RACK their freaking weights. At other gyms you find 50 Lbs dumbells in the cardio area by the elliptical machines. No exaggeration. The gym is not that huge but I never wait more than a minute or two to use any machine. Now and then they install new machines that I don't see anywhere else. Not to mention the music is fantastic so if I forgot my headphones at home I wouldn't have any problem. I just wished that had steam/dry sauna room like the one downtown",86xKGGo7AMwN6DIZXEA3FQ,Bryan J.,90038

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for a particular Spinning instructor named...ADAM! I've taken his class twice and...What an A-hole!!!!!! He's arrogant  and acts as if he's above everyone else there. So unprofessional! He does things like arrange people's bikes to his desired position, regardless of personal needs or preference (the person next to me once couldn't reach the pedals after Adam ""arranged"" it for them) then proceeds to VERBALY ABUSE anyone that doesn't follow his instructions, i.e., not fast enough, hard enough or standing and sitting when he demands - and this is to anyone there - regardless of age or fitness level, woman or man. He's threatening and just vicious to individual people in class, making fools out of them if he doesn't fell they meet his standards. He THREATENS people to leave the class if they cannot keep up saying that ""it's his class and you can leave if you don't like it!"". Spinning classes are for ANY fitness level and people should go at their own pace, not the selfish instructor's pace. He's arrogant and evil, and probably crazy too. DO NOT ATTEND ADAM'S SPIN CLASS if you have any self respect! ADAM SHOULD BE FIRED!!!!!!",RhOuc7yVcfyQAf_6jg6K6Q,Jac O.,90038

The gym's huge, with great machines, plenty of free weights, well-maintained, and affordable. The range of classes is pretty amazing, too. (Michelle Siegel's spin classes are especially kick ass!) Easy parking, too... No winding through 5 floors of a parking garage and dealing with a ticket on the way in & out. I hear that they may be expanding yet again?

They are constantly striving to fine-tune and perfect their facility and services. Whether it's adding the latest equipment, keeping all the machines well-oiled and serviced, remodeling to add new amenities, or adding a massive parking structure next door, Gold's Gym Hollywood works to stay on top of and ahead of the pack. Their cleaning crew reminds me of Disneyland, constantly roaming around, sweeping, cleaning, buffing. A special shout-out goes to Karen Genendlis, the VP Manager, and all-around Queen Bee, for jumping in to help me and my partner get the best membership deals, or problem solve any account issues that come up. When there was a thorny issue that would not get resolved last February, she got on the horn personally to HQ in front of me and blasted her way to a solution. She did the same on the computer for me this morning. Karen, you're the best! Keep up the excellent work!!!",t9Bd8YQwFV5M4h7cU0cMUw,Michael M.,90038

They lie and try to trick you from the very beginning. First I was discussing their membership with them when I was supposed to be getting a free training session and they intentionally kept reminding me that my time was running out as they were trying to get me to sign up. They also said when I started to read it ""oh it only says blah blah blah"". They don't tell you that you are locked into a contract, they don't tell you that you can't visit other gyms and they don't tell you that all classes are not included in you membership. I had some confusion with the membership and Karen told me she took care of it and I would not be billed anymore. The very next month I was billed again. I came in to discuss it and was treated like I was doing something wrong. The fake smiles that I encountered when I signed up were gone and I was NOT rude. The staff sat around kind of listening and kind of giving eachother knowing looks like they were used to people making these complaints. Everytime you complain they quickstep around the subject or give you excuses that they clearly just pulled out of their behinds. The manager GEraldo told me he couldn't do anything until he saw my correspondence with Karen. Although just a minute before he had said that he knew what the situation was and I was confused about what she meant. Its best to just stay out of this gym even though the classes are awesome.

I know and I still go there. My hubby cancels his membership a month right after he signed on. Just to let you know how uncomfortable it gets for straight men. Do stay away if you are straight! NO OFFENCE to anyone just that this is a very click-ish-gym.  Over the years, they keep poshing up the place on a regular basis. They changed the dance floor and swamped those dated fitness machines. The bar is pretty amazing! Give the rainbow of smoothies a chance even if you are just passing by. That's my treat once in awhile. Unlike many fitness places, their dance classes are pretty good. They have some teachers from the Edge teaching.

On the way out, when I validate parking (free for 3 hours!!), again, it's always with a smile and something pleasant is said. The gym itself is always spotlessly clean, equipment well maintained & they're always improving.  The selection of classes are great and the teachers push us hard...but with love & compassion.  This Gold's is going through a major renovation and enlargement--can't wait to see it when it's finished.  Karen, the manager of MANY years, runs a tight ship, truly enjoys her job and making sure each and every one of her employees makes us feel welcome & that we have a good workout. The membership is pretty low key--this is not a gym full o' attitude.  Members are pretty respectful and polite about working in and there's so much equipment, I never have to worry about not being able to do a workout because of lack of machines, weights or space.",9Ff-vOpVQNbpD7XgKUrBTQ,Rob B.,90038

I am not athletically inclined and do not like to be reminded of it. However, Gold's is a clean gym with plenty of up to date equipment and nice employees that make working out bearable. There's usually a lot of people at the gym, but they have enough of every machine so I've never waited. Lots of staff cleaning, training and offering advice, but they don't pester you if you don't ask for help (which I love because I am awkward and like to be left alone while struggling with my light weights). I have taken a few of their cycling classes, and every instructor has been cheery, helpful and motivating. The celebrity spotting is always a plus. Finally, the management is great.

I've never been a gym person, I was always too self-conscious. But I bit the bullet and took advantage of a groupon that was offered earlier this year. After the two month trial period I found myself actually looking forward to becoming a member. The classes are great (I don't know if I've ever enjoyed sweating as much as I do in Michelle's spinning class), the staff is always friendly, machines are always open. I'm kicking myself that I didn't join years ago. And it's the kind of place that if you were to leave your iPad on a treadmill and walk away, they'll hold it safely for you in the office until you call, panicked, an hour later.

It was my first gym membership and I was really excited to start working out. After about a month, I quickly realized that the staff didn't really care about me, but only in their sales as they kept trying to sell me training. After awhile I didn't feel comfortable working out there, so I cancelled my membership. I was hesitant to try another gym but my boyfriend Daniel told me to try Gold's, since there was a ""Sweetheart Promotion"" deal for the month of February. I was hesitant at first, but I walked in and met Karen Genendlis, the GM. She introduced me to Alejandro, a membership consultant and he immediately made me feel at ease. He understood what I needed from a membership and what I needed to do to change my body. I've only been with golds for about a month and I'm already very happy with my decision. I love the equipment, the staff, and the environment and would recommend anyone to try it. Go to Alejandro!!!",cg-R3gpa7jBVx71nC36pdg,Jacquelin A.,90038

Not only is the staff super friendly, but the other members are awesome too. I always have great conversations between sets, they have so many machines (the floor is huge) that there's very rarely any wait, and just as importantly (as I am slightly OCD) it never feels like a petri dish of disgusting post-workout bacteria, unlike many other gyms I've visited that make me wish I had rubber gloves and a full-body parka.

Yet, now  I am older and sadly in terrible shape. So I signed up for the gym...begrudgingly. And they gave me a free training session which I cancelled like 5 times. I was embarrassed to be so out of shape... But they did not give me some lame body building jerk. They have me Rusty...which is basically like giving me an ANGEL! I have never been so comfortable being so uncomfortable! He pushes me to do things I would never attempt alone and I am feeling great. I actually got a second job just to cover training sessions because while they don't fit my budget all the time I cannot live without rusty anymore!! He has helped me feel good again. And this is only the very very beginning of the story. Go see him and you will get it. He makes the gym fun and I am now here at least 4 days a week before work (which is crazy for me), and I am loving it! Love you Rusty!!!",A4W7CSaNPzDS8pSfaOqxgg,katie-coral s.,90038

Rusty is amazing. He's knowledgeable about training and nutrition, and also outgoing and fun, and most importantly, helped me set some seriously ambitious training goals and is making sure I meet those goals. He's a core specialist, which is perfect for what I need. And in just over two months (with a pretty large break in the middle) my body fat went from 25.6 to 20.3 and I feel fantastic, in the best shape I've been in in over a decade.

Karen and her staff have proved time and again that they are the best. I feel very comfortable as a female in this gym, which had been a problem in the past. Their classes always start/end on time and there are always machines open when I want. My favorite class is Celio's Cardio Kickblast, Tuesdays at 710.

I visited on a Friday afternoon, 11/9/12 after 2:00 pm. When I told the manager, Karen, that I was visiting from out of town and probably would only be able to work out there about once or twice a month, she waived the fee and graciously told me to come back anytime. Heather at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful, but the man who gave me a tour of the two-story complex really sold me. He was funny, kind, helpful, and just genuinely made me feel at home. Did I mention that I'm a 40-something, somewhat frumpy mom--not your typical Hollywood hard body! But I never felt intimidated or unwelcome. In fact, I brought my daughter in later just to say hi and the staff greeted us and chatted with us like old friends. I found the gym to be delightfully uncrowded, yet certainly not empty. It was a gorgeous but cool afternoon, so the opportunities for outdoor exercise may have eclipsed the need for indoor exercise at a gym that day. Their updated facilities are top of the line, including an entire spin class room full of brand new LiveStrong spin cycles. Every cardio machine upstairs (minus the rowing machine) has a built in, individual television set. so don't worry if you didn't bring your Kindle or Ipod to work out with. The place looked and smelled amazing, was not stuffy or hot in the least. The locker rooms were spotless, and I had no trouble getting a small locker to store my stuff (for 50 cents, so bring quarters). After an intense workout on the free weights and run on the treadmill, I cooled down with a fat-burning smoothie that was delicious--the Strawberry Blonde. Yummy.

We live in the Bay Area and whenever we visit family, we think about stopping by, but it hasn't happened until today. Our first impression: this place is popular! We could see a full class of mommies and their babes through the window. We walked in and despite the class being full, the vibe was calm and a peaceful respite from the outside chaos. The owner (Ariel) was present, which I appreciated as a consumer. Apparently she's there 7 days a week and takes her business and customer service very seriously. I overheard her talking to other mamas, letting them know about the amazing savings packages, memberships and drop in opportunities they have. Everything was explained with patience and she wasn't pushy at all- quite the opposite- she was warm and friendly and obviously loves what she's doing. Her baby was asleep in the next room which warmed my heart and made me want to support her business even more. When her customers left, she never sat down, busily cleaning and straightening the bright, open space, which was hilarious because the place was immaculate when I walked in! If they had a space like this up north, I'd be living there. You LA mommies are so lucky! My highest recommendation!

Does not matter your skill level you will definitely become a better boxer training with him, just follow his lead.  I haven't be able to train with him recently due to schedule changes but hope to start back again.

The corporate BS on gym rates, leaves beyond much to be desired. Owner has multiple gyms and usage of those gyms is allowed with membership. The Hollywood branch sells for profit by blatantly lying access must be paid for. The DTLA branch is very honest and doesn't try to sell the connected gyms as an upsell. I would recommend going to one of the other gyms this owner controls (DTLA or Valley) and dealing with a more honest administration.",KZjriuPrEzIlzuJEKtBEyw,Emanuel B.,90038

Everyone seems genuinely concerned about making things as wonderful, and easy as possible there for you. Karen, who helped set up my membership was honest, extremely helpful, and showed genuine concern for making sure I reached my goals. My trainer, Antonio, made sure to design a work out for my body type. As someone who is more curvy, I appreciated someone trying to accentuate my body, not just make me skinny. My trainer was so fun, and genuine that I never dreaded coming to work out. Everyone who works there makes you feel beyond comfortable and happy to be there. I've been on and off with working out, tried many different gyms, and Golds Gym is the only gym membership that has actually resulted in to me seeing major results!

Do I wish there was a sauna or fancier perks?  Sure, why not?  But extra perks are rarely free, and I'm satisfied with the status quo.  I can always drive or hop on the metro to the downtown location if I wanted to swim laps or steam myself like a lobster.

I hadn't used a personal trainer in awhile but got a great deal on a couple appointments that were easy to set up. I really recommend Warren!

They've all the equipment you need to work and stretch just about every muscle in your body plus tanning rooms, heavy bags, free weights, all kinds of classes, free lockers (upstairs), hot showers (the complimentary soap, shampoo and lotion are actually decent), juice bar, cold water fountains, outdoor patio, readily available disinfectant and paper towels and the staff is always friendly. They even have complimentary  phones in the locker room incase you lock your keys inside your locker. The phone is connected to the front desk so it can also be used to order a smoothie to be prepared while you change clothes. Nice touch. Another plus (guys) is that there usually is some real eye-candy to be spotted. I mean  I'm not in here just perving on the ladies but I'm not in here with my eyes closed, either! It takes motivation to work out, right?     ;)      Nah, but seriously...this is a great and inexpensive gym. If you're shopping around for gym memberships, swing by for a two week free trail.

They keep taking away weight machines that we need and making the workout area smaller and smaller so it's so crowded and useless. They added this STUPID useless garbage area with Astro Turf that no one uses. The people who are in charge of this gym know NOTHING about working out and they clearly did NOT ask their clientele what they needed. I used to love this gym and now it's complete garbage. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. The already small weight area and lack of benches is now 100xs worse, you will wait forever for a machine now no matter what time you come to work out. The saddest part is they LIED to me before I signed up again for a longer contract promising me 'they would not take out any machines or weights' and they did exactly that. So I was blatantly lied to by the management who then admitted later they've 'never used a weight in their life'. Which is pretty obvious by the way they completely ruined this gym. The lights are too bright now, the new paint is awful. The took out all the good cardio machines and replaced them with cheaper inferior crap that don't even have incline options on treadmills. They took out all the leg presses that everyone needed. The front area with benches and free weights DESPERATELY needed an expansion but NOPE, they haven't added a single chest bench. Instead they put in a huge gross section that can never be cleaned and it's an ecoli MRSA outbreak waiting to happen. They took out bathrooms on the first floor so you have to climb an awful staircase to go pee, which is now a gross cruisey steam room where hideous 900 year old trolls parade around naked all day and clearly have never worked out once. It's disgusting. You can't even wash your hands without being forced to have a glass aquarium full of scary people looking at you thirstily. It's disheartening and it's a huge waste of money and time. Not to mention you're continuously inconvenienced by the constant moving around of equipment and 'upgrades' that always make your experience worse and worse every time. This gym gets worse by the day. Sad because this was once a real body builder gym where people who are serious about getting in shape could go. Now it's like every other crap gym that makes people not want to work out. Only worse because they took the once proud Golds name and turned it into this joke of a gym. They clearly do NOT give a FK about their clients or the people that have been loyal for years. They clearly never asked a single person what they wanted and this 'remodel' was done by idiots who have never set foot in a gym or worked out. Pathetic. Save your money and avoid this train wreck of a sinking ship at all costs.",gNyDWCscTiCEGEpU8xFduA,Hey D.,90038

At another gym in Hollywood that I used to go to, which shall remain nameless, the staff couldn't be bothered to acknowledge you, and the male trainers were too busy talking to each other about getting lucky last night to pay attention to their clients. At Gold's, people actually say hi to you and notice you and keep you motivated. In particular, the general manager Karen is lovely!

There's a ton of cardio equipment on the second floor, all of which is new and pretty spiffy. The first floor is dedicated to all things weight-training and even at it's most crowded I can usually find an open machine/rack/set of free weights/whatever I'm looking for. After years of either working out on my own or doing group classes, I decided to sign up for personal training to tweak my routine that had started to feel pretty stale. I've been working with Nick P. once or twice a week since joining and it's been a nice little wake up call that my old workouts really weren't doing as much as I thought (heh). I've been disappointed with trainers in the past where I felt like I wasn't learning anything new or pushing myself. They'd waste a lot of time going over the basics (even when I'd demonstrated I knew what I was doing and had proper form) with weights that weren't challenging. Nick does a great job of finding out what will actually challenge me without going overboard, while teaching and correcting form for new exercises in a way that is super straightforward. No weird presumptions about what I may (or may not) already know. Glad I signed up!",6ekpV2wELzKgb0ahw-ceAw,Carly T.,90038

Alejandro who is the manager here is probably the absolute WORST person you can possibly deal with. He doesn't return phone calls, or emails, disregards any concerns you have. I had a billing issue after they overcharged me $115 after cancelling. It's been over a month and he still has not had the issue resolved. It's not the $115 I care about its the principle that he should have resolved this issue. If Alejandro was FIRED I would actually think about returning to this gym.

I have been a member of Gold's Hollywood on and off for 16 years now. Renewing membership has always been a ridiculous opaque negotiation. After being away for a few years, this time I though I had it figured out. I signed up for a reasonable monthly payment plan, sucked up my additional $99 registration fee and assumed that was that.  3 months later, a mysterious extra $39 charge appears on my credit card. When I enquired at the gym what it was for, I was told it was a yearly ""Enhancement Fee"" for ""insurance on the equipment and stuff like that"" and that I had no option but to pay it.  I most certainly was not informed of this charge up front and there is no reason they could have not collected it at time of registration. It's just Gold's gross way of trying to skim another $40 off of you and gambling that you won't quit. Well they won. I won't quit, but I am certainly less likely to recommend them to someone else.",S4bhE1N1Hg1uF02aQaTh_w,Eric W.,90038

Upon signing up, I was offered a personal training session. I had never had a personal trainer before and the idea of it seemed unappealing, but I decided to give it a try. My trainer's name was Rimon and he was just great. He genuinely listened to my goals and limitations, and he clearly had a wealth of knowledge on exercise and fitness in general. I would highly recommend Rimon to anyone seeking a knowledgeable, effective and supportive personal trainer. ",VHR59gKFzxQp0HIeewFypA,Gary G.,90038

He has also taught and trained most of the soul cycle instructors in LA and NY. He has a unique style and equally as unique personality. I have trained and taken spinning with Adam for many years and wouldn't think of working out with anyone else. His bedside manor can be interesting at times but he more then makes up for his intensity and outward personality with his true care and dedication to his clients and his work.

And I am eating constantly to fuel my body.  When I started at the gym my body fat percentage was over 29%, as of last Saturday it is 17.5%!!!  Derek is an amazing guy and makes working out really fun but our time flies by way too fast.

I put the money I was going to use for a gym membership towards a tennis club membership, where I was excitedly welcomed and promptly set up.  I'm so glad I didn't join here, and I hope others explore different options for exercise rather than these cookie cutter gyms that couldn't give a flying flip about customer service.  And the real kicker is that when I left the gym after my first and only visit, I saw that same 'fitness specialist' smoking a cig on the hood of his car in the same parking lot that the gym members also use.  Gotta love irony.",rMEJOntrboZXhqa4raTs1Q,Kevin C.,90038

Right now I'm very happy with my body condition. I can do treadmill for hour and still breathable. I just finished 3 of 4 exercises circuit and still be able to walk. I lift almost twice of I usually do. And I also be able to put my butt to my old jeans (That's the best part). If u wanna get in shape I would recommend you to go to Tad. He will put you hard!!

It's always been awesome and it's even better after renovations! The gym is beautiful and nicely designed. It's very big with enough equipment for everyone every time I've been there and it's mostly new equipment since the renovation. The classes are fantastic and plenty to choose from. You have no reason not to get in shape and stay in shape!.. Especially with the Gold's Gym annual challenge where they train you and motivate you to change your body and your life. I've seen incredible results and there are prizes beyond the biggest prize of your new body and healthier life! The instructors are great and really know what they are doing. The bathrooms/changing rooms are very nice with plenty of lockers, plenty of toilets, sinks and showers and there's a wonderful steam room! Everything is very clean and I see the cleaning team always on the go to keep everything sparkling. There is always plenty of street parking, a huge parking lot and new parking structure. It's always easy in and out, not like the gyms in a big shopping complex where it's a headache to drive several levels to get parking and takes forever to get out especially in those complexes with a movie theater as a movie lets out. You can't beat Gold's Gym. And as if all that wasn't enough it's got the best prices for all that they offer. There are also other locations you can visit as well. There is towel service if you choose. Oh and a fantastic smoothie/coffee/food bar with wonderful, inexpensive prices. And the staff is the absolute nicest, most helpful people. I'm always greeted with a smile and hello and always exit with a smile and ""Have a nice day"". Gold Gym is always filled with nice and interesting people and trainers. I have made so many friends there over the years. Honestly my reason to never leave Hollywood is because I never want to leave Gold's Gym! It's what I have to thank for making me strong, healthy and looking good for all these years!",R4XvVyqcGn-2li0-ct9llQ,Mare W.,90038

Then we got the look of death after explaining we'd like to try it out before signing up long term. Why would anyone do this? I have't even worked out here yet?,pIo73J0a7bxCK7q9BHdkzg,Taj A.,90038

They dont help you they just take membership after ghey care about their money after membership you are nothing for them. If you wanna cancel your membership its also not easy they want more money. If you do not pay they still cancel it and after they want all months membership money. It does not matter you use it or not for them. After 3 or 4 minths they call you and say that if you do not pay this money this is going to effect your credit score badly. So please guys dont go this worst gym.

Never had a trainer before and I explained my goals that I had for my body and for my health and they paired me up with Rusty Domhoff. He is a core specialist in addition to being an awesome trainer, kills me in the best way at every session. I've already lost 7 pounds (water-weight not included) in 3 weeks and I'm toning up much quicker than I ever have before. I was doing a lot of wrong things with posture etc and he's been super attentive to make sure my workout is as efficient as it could be plus good for me physically. He's also kept me in line with a healthy diet and informed about a lot of things I didn't know about what I was eating.

I joined in September, after quitting my membership at Crunch in WeHo, trying out Equinox, and working out at several other gyms in LA. When I started, I was about two months out of surgery for an ACL reconstruction, the result of a soul-crushing injury I experienced after taking a group fitness class at Crunch. I joined Gold's to help get me back on my feet. I wasn't sure that I ever would get back to the level of fitness I had accomplished pre-injury, and the bad taste left in my mouth after my Crunch experience made me distrustful of gyms in general.

Clean, spacious, cool temperature, no bad odor, clean bathroom and the diversity of classes. And I always see one or two staff wiping down the equipments although people that come here are all very well mannered, always clean the equipments after their use. That's all on my list and this gym fits the perfect score! The front desk always greets you with a smile. Karen was awesome who initially helped me and my husband with the membership.

I never Yelp but the idea to even sit and take the time to do so was worth it...if you don't already know, Golds does not have a corporate office. It took me long to  get in contact with someone who can help me, it was frustrating! Lets begin: (long story short) Horrible service at Golds Hollywood and the manager didn't help me, basically said ""too bad, so sad, no refunds"" after I paid a full year UPFRONT, 12 personal training sessions (I love my trainer BTW) AND I brought in 3 new members- to the new Glendale location-of course! After paying for all of this, they happily wiped out a whole new payment for 4 additional SESSIONS and said ""sorry, can't refund, you signed, BUT you have 4 extra sessions""-WTF... blah blah, okay, lesson learned: read every single word when you sign, dont feel pressured, if need be: take a sample of their contract and read it at home. So, in the meantine, ive been working out at another gym... Which brings me to this review. I dealt with Hector, who was the main contact and directed my calls, he was so patient. He directed my call to Ashley, she was the absolute best! Definitely exceeded my expectations, got back to every single email right away and although I did not get a refund, its service like this that makes me stay up at night (knowing I need to be up early for work) to make sure I complete this review. Gold's did something right in making sure to put Ashley in this department-- as a matter of fact, they should hire her as the training consultant for all of your Gyms. So I am now a 1) very happy customer who now has 4 extra (unwanted) paid training sessions (with a great trainer btw), 2) happily attending Gold's Glendale (beautiful gym) and 3) happy to know that there are still people in this world who have great customer service skills, so Ashley, thank you! Gold's better watch out, y'all are gonna mess up and have someone offer her a job bcuz you can't get your people right!

Alejandro and lower management staff thinks they run the gym and the GM and Regional manager allow the behavior without putting their foot down. Second time reaching out to the Regional and nothing really gets done. Its like they apologize for their employees but don't really know for what and no change apparently happens. If you have no pride or care how you are treated when things arise then this is the gym for you.,BZmPecQSh54mKwCfgwWGLw,Brandon W.,90038

The sales methodology used here is an absolute disgrace and completely unethical. Let me tell you that your well-being is not in their interest, it's your pocket they like. I don't know what kind of pressure corporate puts on the manager to hit sales quota, but whatever he is teaching his reps needs to be stopped. I come into golds to check out their 19.97permonth special as advertised (obviously falsely advertised) and I come out signing my life for 39.99 a month to a gym I don't feel at home in. The sales person started to swipe away my gym membership and was telling me to sign without telling me what I was signing for. The way this rep handled itself was so pitiful. I can admit that it's my mistake for not reading exactly what I was signing up for, but as a future customer and the stupid facade the rep was putting to make me feel welcome caught my kindness into a trap. The rep tells me to double check the contract and read everything I signed for right AFTER I had already signed. At that point I just felt totally uncomfortable and didn't know how to handle that situation. I thought well maybe this can workout and I'll try to give this gym a chance. What I don't appreciate is dishonesty. Initially, the rep told me I'll have unlimited access to multiple clubs. I thought ""okay, kinda like a 24, if I'm traveling or around another club this membership will be worth"" NOPE. I come back trying to explain how I don't want to be a member anymore and the rep is extremely rude, pretends not to remember me, and starts pressing me instead of trying to give back good customer service. I then ask about multiclub access and the rep proceeds to tell me I can only access a separate club for 14 days and that they told me that??? They never told me that! Again, falsely advertising services that aren't legit. I then tell the rep I'm traveling out and ask what gym is around in which I can access for the stupid minimum of 14 days. The rep gives me a gym, I end up traveling, on my travel I visit the location the rep gave me and it's CLOSED DOWN!!!!!!!!!! How the hell did they not know that? I explained all this to the general manager thinking that as a manager customer satisfaction comes before self-interest, but the response I got was basically ""wow I'm sorry, you have a right to be upset, I can't do anything though, good luck."" Even though the rep might've screwed up by being a self-interested salesperson, at the end of the day it all falls on management and the people leading these reps. Regardless of my experience, I'll tell you why this place isn't worth. ",IGziW60RBmGbFD8kE2zMug,Kevin K.,90038

My boyfriend already went to this gym so I went ahead and joined too. I have only ever been to Gold's Gyms so I can't compare it to other companies. There is a big parking lot that always has space, and the gym validates the parking. The staff is friendly, and there are many options for cardio and weight machines. This gym tends so always be pretty busy, and some of the weight machines are really old and difficult to work with. However, they have a smoothie bar which makes up for every fault in my opinion!",cSWhrhLaAXFl2Z1J9IsL0g,Megan K.,90038

My issue is like all good things it gets loved to death and can become too busy, maybe extending hours or adding more equipment if thats even possible, but regardless it has the best energy most of the time and I belong and use many gyms in LA. I dont believe everything should be for everyone, then its kind of for no one. But this gym comes pretty close. Its particularly for serious fitness types and the more motivated wether a beginner or experienced. There's hard core here and lots of male physique model types for motivation and inspiration.

The majority of people that work out here are gay and I felt safe without feeling like some dude was checking out my ass when bend over on a machine. The truth is it saddens me that I have to write such a bad review but I can no longer take the crap from the staff. ,mcSa32tC8vDsg8yNpYPa9g,Adina D.,90038

It's clean, great new equipment, friendly helpful staff and the energy is not your average gym. The members there are seriously committed to getting results  which makes me want to work harder. Gold's also have free parking for up to 3 hours which is great in that area. The best part all is the affordable membership options. I've referred a couple of friends and got free time added to my membership.

It even says in their notes that I tried calling multiple times in a desperate attempt to cancel; they purposefully ignored me in order to allow fees to accrue. My only option was to cancel my debit card. A year later, I got a call from collections saying that I owe 5 months of payments even though I never went, and never received a single letter. The collections department (Swift Funds) was extremely abusive and dehumanizing, committing serious violations. They ridiculed me, harassed and insulted me, shamed me, called me stupid, said ""no wonder you have an accent"" and started laughing. Shame on Gold's Gym for being associated with this agency, and for making it extremely difficult to cancel memberships when members are out of the country or unable to make in person visits for whatever reasons (injury, for example). Extremely unethical, unfair business practices. This has been very emotionally and financially distressing. I can't believe in 2018 this is still an issue.",CWKe1vu9su9VjS5qrEZrQg,George S.,90038

The place is always packed, people taking up any amount of space available. The free weights room is a jungle, things desperately need to be bolted to the ground so that it's spaced evenly. I honestly do not have many pros for this gym beyond that it's clean. They lack a sauna & you cant even go into the steam room unless you are in a towel. The tanning booths aren't included in the membership I paid for even! ($500 for 15months) I desperately wanted to love Gold's because it was always the mecca of gyms in my mind. Having an actual membership here now has put that image to shame. They need less of these stupid machines and more of the basics. I would rather be waiting on specific machines that I rarely use, but instead EVERYONE is waiting on the main compound lift equipment. (Benches, squat racks, shoulder press chairs, etc) I would love to come back to this review someday and rate it higher, because I like the overall vibe of Gold's.",68UV0egev5-6YNXKU2rjuA,Riley B.,90038

Let's get the record straight on this place today I'm in there working out and the bathrooms are just always so filthy this is no equinox I know but man there's hair in the sink water on the floor and the lockers are just plain nasty hair everywhere like these dudes shed like cats it also always smells like someone died in there too. So I proceed to go and tell the front desk person whom name is Saeed this guy has no concept of customer service maybe if I was getting paid what he was I wouldn't either but still have the dignity and courteous to do your job. He was beyond rude and he ask me why am I complaining about the locker room and I'm like are you serious right now have you been in there. He made it seem  like I was bothering him sorry to inconvenience you for doing your job he pretty much brushed off my complaint refused to give me the GMs card was just downright disrespectful. Now to the crowd in this place is a total side show for the ages and I thought equinox had characters this place takes the cake on that one.  I have never been around so many low budget bleak superficial roided out gays in my life with elitist complexes nobody cares that you looks so amazing half of you are escorts and don't have real jobs anyways  if I didn't have a real job and hoed for a living and took the amount of steroids you do maybe I could look like you too and be in the gym all day without a care in the world. I dread coming to this place to bad I acted a fool and lost my equinox membership to bad and so sad I have to resort to such a hell hole with crummy grimy people. There has to be an equinox alternative out there somewhere. My expectations are too high I forget this place doesn't cost but a mere 40 bucks I was paying 400 a month at equinox and it was immaculate. Just have to expect 40 dollar bad service with filthy bathrooms and rude employees welcome to Gold Gym Hollywood smh!,69sSQJrIOkbHyCoj5yHSPg,Anthony N.,90038

The fitness classes were great, and so was the customer service. Now it just kind of seems after a year that had gone down hill both at this location and Downtown too. I still love the fitness classes, but I can't stand people walking in and out during class grabbing equipment when they should know not to interrupt. I believe that is rude, and there should be a sign saying not to come in when a class is in session. It's happened too many times, and distracts the instructor/students. Also, the customer service is not great anymore. I was standing at the counter a few days ago waiting to be helped and one of the staff members just greeted me by saying what's up twice. Uhm excuse me what's up? Lol that's not professional, we aren't friends. I also ordered a drink at the smoothie bar the other day, they served everyone else(and some who even ordered after me) forgot about me and I was the last person to receive my drink. I wasn't mad, but it was a bit annoying when I had been waiting there patiently. The lady was like sorry, I knew you were waiting but I did not know what you were waiting for. LOL really? I like Gold's Gym, but I'm moving soon outside of LA and will not be renewing. I have not had problems with a lot of members at the gym, but there are a few who can be assholes. I encountered one just standing by the benches right outside of the group training classroom. It was after Barre class, and she was standing there waiting to go in for the Boxing Class. Another member and I were trying to get to the bench to sit down to put our shoes back on. She just stood there even when I said excuse me very politely. Some people lol guess that is Hollywood for you. Overall, my experience has been alright but I need to move on from Gold's. Hopefully my contract was cancelled with no problem, and I don't experience issues.",cCVvDqhyf_zymcCoRgRJuA,Donna R.,90038

You can not compare it with Equinox which is at least 5 times more expensive and some people go there to show off, and not to work out. Meanwhile, at Gold's lots of guys and girls come to work out hard, and they've been doing it for years. Gold's at Hollywood offers clean free towels which is always nice, they have a variety of cool classes you can take, two floors, three hours free parking and many other great perks. It's definitely worth the money you pay. I've been in dozens of different gyms in LA, and this is one of my favorite in terms of value. Thanks",F0ZSFcuO9aK69iaNH--AWw,Stan M.,90038

Cleanliness is important when it comes to a gym. There is always someone cleaning something at Gold's Hollywood; which makes the environment even more comfortable to be in. The Ladies locker room is bright and well kept. There is always someone making rounds and making sure everything is up to par. I travel all round Los Angeles for work so I go to other Gold Gyms in the city when I'm in the area  and none of them compare to Gold's Hollywood. Those other gyms are at a 4 compared to the level of service and preparation that Gold's Hollywood demonstrates. I'm NEVER as comfortable at other gyms, which makes me even more appreciative of Gold's Hollywood as my home Gym. There is nothing like working out and observing staff constantly keeping the facility clean and in order. It makes my time at the gym worth it and an incentive to want to go and workout.

I am a regular attendee of Michelle's Saturday and Sunday morning spin classes and GOOD LORD. Over half of the bikes in the studio have at least one thing wrong with them from broken handle bars to broken tension cranks. Without fail, I know my class complains about this every week and every week, the same damn problems can be found which means nothing is ever done about it. At this point, some of the problems like loose pedals can be extremely dangerous - I almost twisted an ankle the other day because of it.

Michael is the best personal trainer I've ever had, and he is an amazing instructor.  Michael is a profound source of knowledge, in exercise and nutrition, and is a skillful sensitive instructor in class.

If your into 'calisthenics' this gym has everything you need, complete with a full monkey bar system. The other two do NOT have this. They also have a stretching cage, which is rare..... and there is this neat quiet zone off to the side where you can practice boxing on one of several punching bags that are different than the ones hanging in the classrooms, so you can practice boxing WITHOUT taking a class/waiting for one to end. Again, something the other gyms do not have. The price here is also MUCH more reasonable than the other two (24Hr/LAFit).",IKjQ8ptxWGY8EvHGKwYidg,Christopher P.,90038

I got a great deal with a $300 initiation fee but $20 a month for life. They do promotions frequently which is great. It can be pretty busy but I've only had to wait for cardio machines a couple times. For the amount of members they keep it pretty clean and the staff has always been friendly. There's also a smoothie bar with a large selection if you want a post workout snack.,JIQnrBq9dvFzhZzdVqwttQ,Brittany A.,90038

Special thanks to Derek, one of the trainers whom I had the opportunity to personal train with. I didn't continue the training but I took what he introduced and he made a great effort to still encourage me by walking by and just saying how proud he was or that he saw me. Great great gym.

Working out among the Hollywood muscle crowd you'll find neigborhood folk and old time members. Local ettiquette is to let the movie stars work out in peace. Classes from beginners yoga to live p90x pack the schedule. Ample parking in an adjacent lot, towel sevice included. They have a great smoothie bar; the narcoleptic awakening is my favorite. For those grossed out by the mess in the locker room at 24 hour fitness you will be delighted at the regularly attended facilities at this Golds that include a steam room! The locker room is always clean. Big plus for me. Trainers abound for those in need and the counter service and management team are genuinely friendly and helpful.

I'm not usually one to complain about a business unless I feel like it genuinely deserves a bad review so here you go: it took them over a year to replace the boxing bags in the boxing area. After repeated times and complaints from various people they finally did. Now, people at gold's gym will play music on their phone when they workout, I'm not the only one, but since day one I've felt they treat people that aren't their same skin color or dont look like they have loads off money like shit. And I really dont say this lightly. Now I've asked if I could play music due to the fact that I have wired headphones and I've never had an issue in the two years that I've been here until someone by the name of Matthew Gibb came and passed by, and told me that it's policy and I cant play music because it bothers other people. Literally no one looked bothered but honestly I'm fed up with this place and if it wasnt for my contract I would leave this sorry excuse of a gym. So do me a favor and let me cancel it without the ridiculous fee. I be writing and calling until I get someone on the phone as well. PEOPLE check it out for a week before you go.

She takes pride in Golds and is passionate. Warming personality, never combative. You don't have to hunt her down like other associates at other places. The whole staff is very warm but she stands out. You can see that she enjoys helping people and if she can help she will. She handled a billing issue perfectly and tries to go above and beyond.

Unlimited FREE Parking",1016 Cole Ave,4.0,"Gyms,Trainers",Gold's Gym Hollywood,903,2,Hollywood,1/4/2019,I really wanted to like this gym because of the space and variety of classes available.  The set up is also very functional for all levels of fitness. My review is purely based on a complimentary training session with Clifford and overall experience of coming there 5-6 days a week for a year.  Granted this would be considered my 2nd complimentary session.  It was offered as my birthday incentive.   Mind you I am a workout enthusiast and love learning new ways to challenge myself.   Clifford in asked me immediately if I only do free sessions (condescending tone) ??!!!  Free shaming me.  Even so! What professional would conduct any relationship in that manner unless he felt entitled enough to put me in my place for no real reason other than trying to demean me. While  training me he was clearly eating his protein bar on the floor and talking to his peers in between (probably because it was complimentary).  He then approached a sales rep only to acknowledge loudly that I don't feel confident in their staff as expert fitness instructors.  I felt disrespected on many levels.  When our session was complete he just walked off as if I no longer existed.   He apparently is one of the managers there.  I realize dealing with people on a regular basis is a emotionally taxing job . But Clifford went out of his way to in some way humiliate me.  The thought of having to come back there and seeing him brought to many negative feelings and probably old wounds from being bullied as person struggling with body issues.   ,mZOV4XisamFjWfXfgilT6Q,maria n.,90038

It's well maintained and clean. The people who work here are friendly and helpful. The open hours are awesome. I don't think I've ever come here and it's closed. They sometimes even stay open later than the posted time because they know people don't finish exactly on the hour. Busy times are 5:30-7:30p and I don't come that often in the morning to know the peak periods then. Saturday mornings are the busiest of all. ,3SKu0QnOG5jG-s8OROOdBw,fred n.,90038

It does get quite crowded in the evenings, though. There is one big problem with this place that I must identify here because the management of Gold's Gym Hollywood refuses to do anything about it. A member who appears to be homeless is permitted to bring his dog into the gym. It is NOT a service dog. A service dog is trained to behave a certain way; this dog shows no evidence of any such training, especially considering that the dog urinated on the artificial grass workout area, while I watched in horror. I've attached a photo of the dog and its owner in the locker room. I've reported this to the LA County Dept of Public Health.",By81ZzYZP6JndktFjFQncA,The Dude B.,90038

They have a spinning room that you can use at any time, a wide variety of machine's and plenty of them. You always see at least 3 to 4 staff members , vacuuming, mopping, or wiping down the equipment. They also have a smoothie bar that makes great smoothies. They also have free validated parking for their members. This is a great place too get in a serious work out, what ever it is you want to focus on.

They lost me at $26 for my first class and ludacris playing during the yoga session. They should offer a first time chance for free because it's a unique concept and should allow their customers decide whether or not it's for us. The music playlist was terrible. It got better toward the end with the piano and more yoga appropriate. I don't understand how anyone can concentrate while listening it ""throw them bows"". Also, it was my friends first time doing yoga and he was wobbling and falling all over the place and was completely lost and confused and the instructor gave him little attention. My friend left just as confused as he came.

I'm so surprised at all the favorable reviews-- but maybe this place is more for those not really looking for the true yoga practice.  The branding is strong and the place is clean, modern etc-- everyone is nice and friendly. Its just not authentic yoga. Thought I would enjoy the namesake ""playlist"" of it all but I actually didn't care for the loud music/instructor on headset mic vibe.  The whole thing seemed very amatuer to me, the instructor's flow was choppy and generic. No intention at start of class nor speak about anything meditative. I knew it wasn't going to be a hot class (I love hot) but it did steam up in there which I didn't mind at all. The light swear I got was the best part of the workout for me. Mats are positioned way too close to one another and the whole reserved mat space thing is just weird to me. I come from core power and have now realized how much better it than most yoga studios. They really invest in their training and it shows when you take from other instructors who are not as seasoned. Don't wanna knock this place too much as everyone was super nice. Just not for me. If you don't really like the entire yoga experience and are looking to do the poses in a trendy kind of way, you might like it here.

Awesome one hour yoga class that starts and finishes on time with no dogma.  I liked that you can reserve your spot in the room. I didn't connect with the music like rise nation across the street it's mostly hip hop.  I tried a few teachers and never found one that had an actual playlist that I liked.  Maybe  I am too old (50) for the taste in music.   I did a two week pass at playlist and went every other day. Lots of standing poses and the transitions could be a little better on some of them.  This is vinyasa flow kind of class up dog down dog etc.  When they start ""flipping the dog"" it just seems unsafe and unnecessary.  There are some yoga sculpting and pilates moves in their sequence which make it more safe and balanced than many yoga flow classes.    This is a great yoga place for mixed levels and is fun and upbeat. I also did not have a single teacher come over and adjust me or make any personal suggestions. Some of the teachers talk constantly and I would prefer less talking over the mic and more inspiration from the music connected to the practice. Instead it's just a standard vinyasa set to loud music with a teacher talking loud through a mic.",5jfyBtGuROuh_vCXwiJcmA,Larry T.,90069

They also told me they had cancelled my order because they ran out of the product.  It would have been nice to have been notified without having to send so many unanswered emails, wasting my time calling a busy line.  I did receive a refund, a month later for being charged twice for pants I never received.  Great clothes, but they treat you terribly and I just cannot get behind a company that's so bad to its customers.  They did not offer any type of resolution when I finally spoke to someone, and were very dismissive of my experience.",Dz5X8lVLfLH-Cmziwv0kxQ,Sarah M.,90210

This place is amazing the location is great and clean and welcome. I had the best session I have ever had with Jamie, she was down to earth, nice. She explained things well and she didn't have to yell or scream because the music she chose was calm and not loud. Loved it. I went back the next day and left with a headache the girl Myla had to scream the whole time which wasn't relaxing and I took the lower heated class because I tend to sweat quickly and a lot. But the class she said the heat was acting us but never tended to it to make sure it was ok and she never checked in with us if it was to hot. The techno style music was a bad choose and way to loud. Did not leave relaxed or happy. I hate to right bad reviews about someone but this was a big difference in instructors. Both were amazing people tho. Just two way different styles. It's depends on what you're looking for a guess. Loud techno music should be band tho.",s8egOtBtwzuJy2ypXrwejg,Lindsay S.,90028

It was a beautifully candle lit space and heated perfectly...not too hot like Bikram. The studio is spotless and everyone was very welcoming at the desk. The one thing I really was bothered by was the playlistin. My two friends I went there with agreed as well. The atmosphere did not fit the poorly chosen top 40 hip/hop/pop songs that are over saturated on the radio in LA. I mean... I was expecting something more therapeutic to match the zen surrounding. She did not even lower the lighting to set the mood with the candles. I was so focused on waiting for the songs to pass (I mean this was like radio disney/something you would hear at a Bat Mitzva) and I was not present at all. (I know I need to personally work on being more present anyway..:)) The instructor was great, but music really attracts me to specific teachers to keep me returning back to the studio. (Sara and Myla at Sherman Oaks have awesome music!!!!)  I think it's important for each teacher to put together better play lists. I realize everyone has different music tastes, but I will definitely not return to a class with bad pop songs. The chalk board outside asks what songs people want to flow to. I think it's a great idea and I would even go to lengths of getting a comment box with suggestions. Otherwise, I love this gorgeous studio and the amount of classes they have all day!!! Five stars.",FTCNb0RHCCWQf2y6mP_4og,Becky L.,90028

I was interested in a studio that had a free week so I could get the full experience and really feel out the studio. I started 2 days ago and already I'm in love. I've only taken the C1 class since I haven't done yoga in a couple of years. Both times I have taken Katie Br's class. She is amazing! I've never written a review on any class instructor before but I have to give credit where it is due. She immediately makes you feel comfortable and has the amazing ability to push you to your limits in a respectfully kind and encouraging way. Both times I've taken her class it's been no more than 3 of us in the room (amazingggg) and she has given hands on assistance and massages!!

Well, it's really hard for ME anyway, judging by the two extra pounds I brought home with me from my LA trip. On one of my last days there, I had a desperate need to sweat out some of the toxins that I'd been torturing my body with all week. My bestie and I decided to check out a class at Core Power Yoga. She had been to a class there and loved it. Even though we both drank heavily the night before, we dragged ourselves in to the (gorgeous!) location to make our penance. We had signed up for the 10:30 am Hot Power Fusion class with Kris L. After making our way through the maze of hallways, we deposited our stuff in the (equally gorgeous!) changing room and made our way into the (gorgeous but hotter than the hottest layer of hell!) studio. Shortly after that began the best yoga class I have ever experienced in my entire life with the best instructor I have ever experienced in my entire life. I would take this class over and over and over again. I felt alive. I felt beautiful. I felt strong and appreciated and celebrated. I guess I kinda fell in love a little bit.... with Kris and with myself. She was just so open and expressive and appreciative of everyone's efforts. My best friend felt the same exact way, and we scrambled to check the schedule. Was she teaching every day??? Every class??? If so, we would BE there!!! Alas... our dreams were shattered... she only teaches that one class all week and I (living in NYC) would never see her again. Well, I can't help but think that both of us were destined to take that class... destined to meet her... destined to have that physical and emotional shift at that hour, on that day. Now that I know those feelings are possible, I want to find a place in New York where I can feel the same. I kinda think Kris may be one of a kind though, in which case... MOVE TO NYC!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!",6eipwrk2ZjOdvuD6GI-TTw,Molly D.,90028

First and foremost it has become way too expensive at almost $25 per class. Even with a package or monthly deal it is just too much money to spend on fitness. But even more the reason is that it seems to have become more about recruiting teachers rather than customers. I get emails almost daily about some new teacher training program but never about a class offer or package deal or some incentive to remain as a customer. They are cranking out so many teachers who sadly enough are not always actual certified yoga instructors but merely have the training to teach one specific Core Power class. Anyone can go in and train in one class style and become a ""teacher"". Many classes, depending on the teacher, are becoming more like a fast paced aerobic style fitness class that lack a true yoga experience. Seems like the owner(s) are more interested in filling their pockets off of teacher training than recruiting and maintaining customers. Eventually there will only be teachers and no one to teach a class too.",TAk3s8ADPyMvoxaaZ4NCGQ,B L.,90028

I am a huge fan of heated yoga that is not bikram, where the studios smell and are unsanitary because of the carpeted flooring. All CorePowers I've visited have clean facilities with hardwood floors and offer a variety of classes throughout the day. My favorite class for years has been Hot Power Fusion, which I believe is the hottest class. Lately I've discovered CP2 which I also really like and incorporates more vinyasa (flow).

The music is SO loud it's insane and the teachers scream over the music. I mentioned it and was told that's not normal and must have been a random teacher doing something out of the ordinary. Really? Because I just took a 10PM class thinking it was late and would be calm and it was INSANE. The teacher, Ryan, blasted music so loud I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack and SCREAMED so loud over the music it made you want to join the army because boot camp was probably easier in comparison. The ENTIRE class. I tried plugging my ears which he clearly saw and he proceeded to turn the music up. Lol. This place is the absolute worst.

The elevator was out of service so we had to walk six flights of stairs. We arrived two minutes late and were locked out. When I called the lady she was rude and told me it was my fault for being late. Class pass charges you 20 dollars for missing a class so it would be 40 for my daughter and I when I told the lady this she said that I should have been on time and to call class pass and deal with it.

I am a very happy and positive person and he was being very cold in the way he gave off direction. You would think the instructor would be friendly to get you to keep on coming back, but I was given a negative reaction as if I did not belong. I come to yoga to relieve stress and I felt more stressed out when I was leaving. The studio was nice and clean but parking was hard to find.

The quality is so thick and the cropped pants are so incredibly flattering. And i love the variety of prints and colors they have. (The only drawback at this point is that they're new and growing and when you order from the website, they can't exchange at the store- its 2 separate entities and they have to ship it back to the warehouse for credit) But back to the store- the people at the store- every single time I have visited- have been so incredibly helpful, enthusiastic, non-pushy...etc. Next, the kombucha, coffee (soy lattes) and novelty chocolate bars they have for sale are so unique and delicious. The whole experience is just amazing. And a special shout-out to Lisseth and Cam at the store who were extra kind, helpful and just so pleasant to deal with!",EWv2bU_N39SnnhCaQb921w,Lisa D.,90210

Walk Thru the Back Door!",7226 Melrose Ave,4.5,"Spray Tanning,Tanning Beds",Melrose Tanning Company,158,1,Fairfax,3/27/2013,"I have never in my life been to a worse salon (been tanning for at least 8 years) I was promised all sorts of things to sign a reoccurring contract. One of their employees accused me of taking a one use lotion package, mind you upon signing up I bought a $65 bottle of hypoallergenic lotion as my skin is sensitive which they kept at the salon for me, one of the staff also told ""me they have cameras in the rooms"" so that's how she knows I used the this package of lotion. Super creepy! Plus their parking really should be for 2 cars and they somehow made 3 parking lines so if you park in the middle forget about leaving until another car leaves and most of the tjme their spots are filled by people not even visiting the salon but they keep it extremely understaffed so they can't enforce this convenience nor provide a creep free place where you can feel comfortable tanning naked without the fear of their receptionist possible watching you!  STAY AWAY!!! If you do decide on going to this salon considered yourself warned. And don't park back their if you care about dents and paint scratches on your car as Melrose tanning could care less. When complained about the parking situation their response was ""if you choose to park in a spot we generously provide, DEAL WITH IT!"" I'm shocked. As mentioned before theirs only one person working at all times which means during rush hour they also need to clean the beds, on 3 occasions I found sweat still their from last person (yuck) when asked if they could clean it i was given a look and attitude and made to feel like wanting something sanitary was ridiculous. There are plenty of sanitary salons with ample parking and NEW beds in the area. Why pay more than other salons charge for beds salons were using 8-10 years ago when I started tanning.

Walk Thru the Back Door!",7226 Melrose Ave,4.5,"Spray Tanning,Tanning Beds",Melrose Tanning Company,158,4,Fairfax,5/15/2013,So far my favorite tanning salon in Hollywood. The place is super clean and pretty inexpensive. The bulbs in the beds seem to be changed frequently. I saw results super fast. Their tanning lotion is priced very weil. If you sign up for a tanning membership they give you good discounts on the lotions. The only thing is that a few of the employees are not friendly. I wouldn't call them mean... just kinda blahhhh.  I would totally spend more money there if they talked to me about the new products or upgrades. I guess the lack of enthusiasm of the employees saves me money though. Overall I totally recommend this salon!!,NEHxtF3VzHhQUp-G_aPlEQ,Barbara C.,90046

Went to do an air brush for the first time and the staff there are very friendly- they tell you what to do and expect and over all super nice. I went with the medium tan and it turned out pretty well! Sticky for the first day after getting it done but after u shower the next day it jut looks like a normal tan from the beach. I've tried several self tanning lotions from Lancôme to Loreal but I could never get it right on my hands and feet and it would often look funny when it was fading away. They do a very good job with that. They told me it should last for about a week so lets see if it looks natural when it's fading. $45 for first time airbrush plus gratuity. Good location, probably would come back.",DIf2JXpwBX83rZZuUTqKcQ,Maria L.,90046

I went here twice for a spray tan and turned orange both times. I explained to the woman spraying me the second time that I turned orange the first time, and she took that into consideration when spraying me. Sadly, I turned orange on that second spray. I just called the salon to see what steps I could take to fix the orange-ness, and the owner was combative, rude, and interrupted me when I spoke. He told me he wasn't going to take the blame since he didn't spray me, tried to blame it on me for not telling him personally that I turned orange before I got the second spray, and said I should have requested a different solution (I didn't even know they had two solutions). Not very good business practices, and I'll be trying out Organic Shimmer.",7NoFmlcw1-sVS0JFawUEIQ,Sara P.,90046

I could not believe that any place of business would have such catty disrespectful person working there that would spray tan nude women when they were so unprofessional and judgmental. I live close by and went in to talk to the manager about how I was treated. The assistant manager was at first rude, then I asked why and he said eh was tired, didn't sleep and his voice was angry and said he had work to do and that the guy apologized and he ha to get back to work. I couldn't believe that this man was just as rude. He then switched as I spoke calmly about how I was treated and was nicer with more understanding.. He offered me a gift like a free an and was trying to make it up to me which I understood and appreciated but I would never go back there to any place where I would have to be nude in front of people this judgmental and disrespectful, immature and catty. I appreciated the gesture but that was it for me when I heard how I was being talked about when they didn't think I was listening because they thought the phone was hung up. I had to explain that I was moving around my schedule to fit it in and it that seems crazy that I changed my mid a few times, that is ludicrous. I am a very busy person with my schedule packed. I had to think about my other appointments an process time. I would never want any woman to go to a place where they would be judged ridiculed. If they are saying that about someone on the phone changing their appointment twice, what are they saying after they spray than you and see you naked?. For anyone who has been here a while and it has been fine, great. This was my experience and I wanted to share it.",aezT5CUSfRRlibeAwmzpQA,S P.,90046

Since I am, by nature, silly, I have always found them awkward and cheesy, often feeling the antithesis of sexy. Like when I was asked to crawl sexy and seductively on the floor, but looked more like I was dehydrated, traipsing through the sand, and looking for water in the desert.  Evolve Dance Studio is legit! The pole dancers use the pole as their pallet. I have seen a few of them perform, most impressively, Mina. The dancers contort their bodies into every shape imaginable like Cirque performers. They do the latest tricks that leave you saying ""WOW!"" They choreograph routines that are awe-inspiring, and they throw a little raunchy in it to truly legitimize them.  Mina is a great teacher and her background in dance helps in her instructional process. They play great music, which, in itself, inspires you to move seductively. The prices are great compared to other pole dancing classes, plus the classes are small so it is worth the money, and you can use a credit card which is awesome!  The studio does not look like much from the outside (actually it is kind of a sketchy neighborhood) but inside they have designed a really nice ambiance with great lighting.   I recommend you give the pole a whirl at least once!",Gy60a9Pq2U9dJghrvDB9zA,Sarah K.,90019

This studio was ok. As far as the layout... I wasn't too fond of 4 poles on one side of the room and 4 on the other. How do you teach a class that way??? Seems like an instructor has to play double dutch to give equal attention to both sides. PLUS 4 poles are shorter than the others... So it seems like it was made for smaller classes 4 students or less per side. Either way, this place is ok... But needs some sort of customer service during the times classes are due to start. So people know the class will still happen. They need to open up on time for 1... 2, not be rude to paying customers when they are leaving... was chit chatting a bit directly after class and the instructor got all bitchy talking about we were 'disturbing her class' please...

I also love, love, LOVE that they limit the class size- I have never had to share a pole, and even though it is true that sometimes the teachers are off helping other people, I never find myself just standing around- I am either working on new tricks or perfecting old ones. I like the free style of the classes, I think that it allows each person to work on what is important to them, and to develop their own pole style. My only wish is that there were more morning/afternoon classes offered during the weekdays. That being said, the studio is cute and clean and everyone who works there is nice and welcoming!",A46rPA7KzqvNj30ieu5-gg,Em B.,90019

I plan on consistently going to classes so I can get in better physical condition--have a good 20 lbs. to lose.  The studio offers other types of classes like samba, hip hop, and dance hall which I can't wait to enroll in.  I talked to a couple of girls that were advanced pole students (they were amazing pole dancers themselves-btw) who were excited about the new types of aerial performance classes that they are going to be starting soon.  Looking forward to seeing what that's all about too.  Overall, a great dance studio with lots of options for the novice as well as the experienced dancer.  I will recruit my friends, I know they'll love it too!",uI0CNy9oYJFlfKHoRLKcJA,Aiko H.,90019

She is extremely talented, she made the moves fun yet challenging, and she was very good at working with beginners. She made it comfortable for everyone to try their best even if we were new to his type of dance. I felt like it was ok to make mistakes and that made it a much more enjoyable experience.

She recognized that we were each at different experience and skill levels and gave more challenging movement options to the more advanced students and was patient and supportive with the beginners. When I struggled with a spin she came over to my pole and talked me though it and didn't leave till she saw improvement. I'll definitely be taking more classes with Lori.

My experience with the 3 different instructors I've had over approximately 6-8 classes with Evolve, is that all of their instructors are hands on! They are all extremely talented, and inspire me to be better based on their bodies alone, aside from the pole work. The classes start on time, and at the end I've had a few classes where they went a little longer than scheduled, which was a plus.

This class is terrible and extremely boring. I would only suggest this class if you have never in your life taken bellydance before. The class was made up of extremely basic movements which should have been the equivalent of a warm up. By the way the same 4-5 movements were used for the entire class - hip drops, shimmy, snake arms, upper body basic isolations as well as moves that are NOT bellydance moves. I love to dance and have taken many different forms so when I select a bellydance class I expect to bellydance. Instead this class was kind of bellydance and a mix of twerking, African and Afro-Brazillian dance. Only 1 song could pass for being Middle Eastern (it actually sounded more Hindu) all of the others were hip hop. Again I have nothing against hip hop music or other dance types but when the class is listed as one thing I expect it to be the thing I signed up for. This teacher definitely has not really studied the art of bellydance. In addition there was absolutely ZERO choreography. She just focused the 4-5 moves and if anyone got out of sync she made the entire class stop and start again. I can understand if this were a competition team or we were learning choreography but for a basic class this is ridiculous. There was literally no joy in dancing here. Honestly the lack of knowledge of this teacher was so appalling I don't know if I would ever test another class at this studio.",TpUKqo6oTIL6YsSsSTySPg,Jennifer J.,90019

I clean the poles with sanitizer before I use them but I guess it wasn't enough. I went to urgent care and I got ringworm from the studio on my hands.... It was so embarrasing I didn't even ever go back to get a refund. The classes are fun and the instructors are knowledgable but I have been scared for months after to even try pole dancing classes at another studio even. I've never had ringworm before and I was pretty horrified to know I caught something like that. Word of caution if you do decide to go bring your own sanitizer and wear socks and gloves. Their sanitizing spray apparently is not very effective. I do not recommend this place unless you want to get ringworm.

First of all, I never considered myself athletic. I never played sports or even have a rhythm for dancing. However in the last two years, I've tried crossfit, yoga and stand up paddle boarding for workouts. I'm ready for something new so I checked online for my choices of pole dancing classes. I first went to a famous dance studio on Wilshire and La Brea because they offered 2 free classes. The place was nice and the people super friendly. But of course the free classes were a bait for their sales people to attack you. Talk about pressure sales! They will lock you into a series of only one - 2 hour class a week which costs $239/ month for 8 weeks, $219/month for 24 weeks, or $195/month for 48 weeks. If you want to avail of their unlimited classes you'll have to pay an extra $249 to get unlimited classes only at your level. I tried one class to see if it would be worth it. They taught me one pole trick in two hours and focused on female empowerment. Nothing wrong with that but I felt shorted. I just want to learn to pole dance. Did I mention you'll share the pole with two others during the class? ",sFmZWUq3XVKQEUzW7gzCUQ,Dana A.,90019

I took an intro to pole class and was pretty happy with the instruction.  The class was small and I felt like I got really great instruction from the teacher.  Learned some spins and walking around the pole.  I didnt realize pole dancing can be somewhat technical and it's pretty challenging.

And going back to the teachers! I cannot thank them enough; each teacher has his/her own style and technique so find the one that works for you. Don't be shy and try out ALL the classes if you can. They're so much fun and the energy they bring to the classes really get you amped up. The studio is clean and beautiful, and I've never had an issue with management. Lani is very sweet and accommodating, but don't forget to cancel classes 6 hours before! Rules are rules lol!

I came over from London and wanted to continue lessons and she has made me feel so at home. The instructors are incredibly talented and so inspirational - check out Jamé Ellis who should have a PhD in Polosophy!  She has taught me the deeper meaning of pole dance. All in all I would highly  recommend Evolve studios as a place to dance, be in a beautiful space around people who are both beautiful inside and out. Superb!!!",R4izwGvV5EJBJOwyrdS8gQ,Somi D.,90019

From the first time I stepped in to this studio the reception lady (girl with big hair) was really rude and condescending. I was shocked with the treatment and really put off. I tried pole dance classes with 2 different instructors and they're both have rather poor pole dancing skills. To add to this the room upstairs has really weird shape and majority of it has low ceilings so forget about proper climbing the pole. ,M-v2tKfYFpvHzdxW6hAaUQ,Sav K.,90019

A lot of places ask you to do this and it's LA, so I assumed they are probably a very busy spot.  When I asked to book an appointment for two, the guy answered in the RUDEST voice ""TO DO WHAT?"" It was so loud and rude my boyfriend could overhear it standing beside me.  I was honestly so shocked I probably sounded like an idiot with my response, but I essentially was like ""Nah, I'm good"" and hung up. I'm sure this place is great, just make sure you don't call to try to book an appointment for a bed. Apparently, that's only for people that are wanting airbrush tans.

Had your employee been kind and calmly explained the situation, I would have left and understood. I found it really disappointing that your ""manager"" gave me so much attitude when I was extremely polite and instantly labeled me as someone trying to basically scam the system rather then trusting that I would call when I got home with my new card. The payment wasn't a day late... I walked in on the day you charge my card. My complaint for the millionth time, you don't seem to understand, is the customer service!!!! Not the rules!!!! Your employee treated me like a peasant and instantly had a problem with me the second I walked in the door. That is my complaint..... I will take my business elsewhere, where customers aren't assumed to be broke and scamming the rules - where customers are trusted until proven otherwise.

But this is hands down, no questions asked, THE BEST spray tan I've ever had. It lasts, it stays even, it survived the ocean and chlorine in pools on my vacation. And this was with little to no moisturizing and upkeep. It doesn't rub off on your clothes after the first rinse. I have driven 3.5 hours just to get a spray tan here for events. It's that worth it. I would absolutely say this is the best tanning place in LA. The owner is so kind and wonderful and it's a comfortable experience. He is a genius at contouring and making your body look it's best. I feel pretty, fit, and ready for anything after coming here. If you haven't been you need to. And the prices are super reasonable. If you want the very best spray tan come here.

Finished a little before 10:30am; just in time for Steve's yoga class. I've been meaning to take his class for a while now and I'm glad I finally got to it! I LOVED IT. I used to religiously practice hot yoga in various indoor studios and it was my first time taking a class outdoors! Such a different level of relaxation... The sound, sight, and smell of beautiful Mother Nature all around.............. LOL! ok, but seriously though... it was so peaceful. I would say it's great for all levels; basic poses for beginners but enough repetitions and a fairly fast pace so it can be a bit of a challenge for intermediates/advanced yogis. LOVED that it stretched me out right after my hike and I felt so refreshed after class I hiked Runyon two more times! (My ass and legs have been sore for two days! holy... it hurts so GOOD!)",_KDforIDsQS6bIaJi0_V0g,Elysse P.,90046
,2000 N Fuller Ave,4.5,Yoga,Runyon Canyon Yoga,42,3,Hollywood Hills West,5/4/2013,When I first arrived this was first time doing yoga at runyon canyon and wanted to make sure that I found a great place that had flat ground which I did find. He started out with instructing us to focus on the breathe and to not worry about the poses which I think is a great way to start off. As he progressed he did walk around and modify us in order to open up and get the best and be most effective in each pose. He also asked the group if we would like to do headstands and I personally am not a fan of doing them and don't wanna have injuries in trying to do them so I didn't push myself to do them. He did the group that we didn't have to do them if we didn't want to which I thought was nice so that no one felt like they needed to do something that they didn't feel safe doing.,DLYZTm0t4BjOcMoJ63sMXg,Megan W.,90046

And because I'm old it takes longer for my muscles to grow. So I asked my PT if he knew a good place and he suggested that Pilates would probably be good for me. I went to R.A. Physical Therapy and their Pilates instructor is Seong Ho who is also a highly trained ballet dancer. She is amazing! She started with gentle stretching and exercises so I've never injured myself. I might be slightly sore for one day but then I'm fine. I went back to my PT recently and he was amazed. My stiff shoulder had gained over 30 degrees movement. I had been so weak it was hard to get up off the floor if I got down. Now I get up easily. I'm able to do much more difficult Pilates exercises. And Seong is such a nice person.

Don't be fooled by the gimmicky hot yoga craze and gym style studios out there. Some of them are more like yoga zoos, with 50 students crammed in and no individual attention. And that high feeling you get from hot yoga? That's oxygen deprivation. All you're doing is putting yourself at risk of injury and dehydrating yourself. Yoga should incorporate mind, body and spirit, and Namastday does that. Have the patience to practice Iyengar, and you will reap the rewards. The classes might feel slower paced, but it's for good reason. If you're not careful, you will develop injuries over time, even if you don't feel it now! It happened to me after 15 years of practice, and only Namastday was able to help me eliminate my knee and wrist pain. These teachers have had serious training, not a two week crash course.

They canceled it (actually shortened it to two abbreviated days)  five days before the workshop began due to low enrollment. It wasn't able to cancel my flight, so I just ate the ticket. I understand that stuff like this happens, but it was the way it was handled that was upsetting; while they refunded the money, they never worked with me to find an alternative - they simply canceled with an apology. Also, the decision maker (manager/owner) communicated through a receptionist rather contacting me directly to sort things out...poor form, IMO.

I completely agree with another reviewer... It feels like a factory. Or a gym where it's overcrowded. Too many people and not enough personal care or guidance. I felt like I was farmed out to one young aid to the next. And had to continually look out for an office door opening and people walking past when I was trying to do difficult exercises. I tried this place out after my previous physical therapy place no longer took my insurance (Larchmont which has an awesome staff.) After about a five minute consultation with the doctor, I was put on an exercise machine for 5 minutes and then a group of about 3 very young assistants took me through some repetitive exercises that felt very ""one size fits all"" versus any sort of personal care. I had ACL surgery on my knee. They assistants seemed to all take turns going from one patient to the other. And at times not even be watching at all.  And then at the end I spent 15 minutes with the doctor who said he'd email me excercises and then never did. I did not feel confident at all that they'd get my knee or me back to a competitive sports playing level. I'm now going to Function PT down the hall - which I absolutely love!! The doctor is great and the aid was equally attentive. I wasn't farmed out to multiple aids and didn't feel like I was in a gym at rush hour. I guess it depends what you like. I will say, the aids and the doctor were nice at Back 2 Health, but I do not like how this place is run. In my opinion it's awful.",SpDAgfYCicqL_9G6mjmY4Q,Cher G.,90028

I went here in acute pain from an injury. After talking with a doctor for 10 minutes they took me to a gym where I was told by an aid to do some exercises with my arms. While doing them, she walked away to help someone else. In my few visits, this happened repeatedly where aids supposedly supervising my recovery disappeared, at times with a new aid later walking up and asking me where I left off.  Then you wait like an assembly line for the PT doctor to work on various other people until he or she finally comes back for a short treatment.  I guess people working here are too busy bc they schedule several patients around the same time. It is also a dingy space with bad music and televisions blasting at you.

""Well, we just want you to get on track and feel better; That's our goal.""  The Doctors are really nice and observant of the details you give them.  Often I've experienced doctors who don't listen.  This would not be the case at Back 2 Health!  I can't say enough good things.  After 12 years of a diagnosed kidney disease and bad pain I was recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  I still do not know much about it, but my rheumatologist (sp?) wanted me to begin aquatic therapy immediately.  The pool at Back 2 Health has been refreshingly therapeutic.  Although my insurance does not cover Back 2 Health, I'm trying to figure out how to make it work financially, so I can remain getting the proper (and fantastic) care that I have received these last few weeks.  They accept most major insurance companies, but unfortunately mine is through my employment and not in network.  If you have any hesitation or doubt, erase it now!

You can walk in at your leisure or make an appointment which is so convenient. When I arrive, the staff is ready for me with a specialized treatment plan that is fit to address my specific needs. They take the time to address my concerns and spend time talking to me about my condition, level of pain and treatment plans. This place is the true definition of a treatment facility!! Not only do they have a full gym to work on stretches but I had the choice of doing ultrasound, aquabed or the large pool with workout equipment in the pool. I have never seen another clinic so high tech as this one! The facility is clean and comfortable and the clinic is in a convenient city location. Time and time again I see the same people coming back. My back pain was so severe I could barely work or move. Even touching the area evoked such a horrible pain.

So I stopped doing PT altogether, and relied on massage, but one overly zealous masseuse made things worse and re-injured me.

Yes, there's  plenty of kundalini yoga in NYC, but Tej is the master teacher. The energy generated in her classes will clear out whatever's holding you back and uplift you. If you are new to kundalini, it's all about aligning your energy using your body as the tool--in other words, while other forms of yoga (at least in this country) emphasize perfecting the body, here it's your whole self, including your dreams and ambitions. However for me, because it's dynamic, as opposed to static stretching, my body has gained more mobility and flexibility than was possible with the other yogas.

A great example of why it's not worth the trip anymore is a recent class in which a student was snapping and popping gum the entire time--loudly.

So, not only was it rude in general, but it was disrespectful to a colleague, AND, the worst being: it was a yoga instructor doing that in a yoga class.

L.A., Brentwood and Santa Monica areas,  and never once have I hankered to return to ANY of them.  I always felt good after the classes, because one tends to consistently feel great after doing yoga, but Aura Yoga was a different experience from the moment I arrived.  I was greeted by a darling girl behind the desk who made me feel immediately at home, and sitting right there on the other bench was the instructor named Nikka, whose genuine, non-saccharine  welcome was like a ray of sunshine.  My friend arrived and we entered the room so we could begin a sublime 75 minute power flow class that left me dripping, relaxed, elated, rejuvenated and pleasantly exhausted at the same time.  What was so special?  First of all, the lighting.  The room was awash in a low, relaxing cobalt and purple glow, which immediately felt soothing to me.  As Nikka led us through an excellent, challenging class, she subtly altered the room's illumination with color and intensity to reflect where we were in the practice.  There was low music as well, but none of the lighting or music felt intrusive or contrived, just beautiful and atmospheric.  During shivasana, Nikka anointed each of us with a gorgeous aromatherapeutic oil on our shoulders.  It was so nice.  I couldn't get over what a lovely experience the whole thing was, and I couldn't get the beautiful light out of my mind, either.  I was so intrigued, that I went onto their website, which was very clear and easy to navigate.  I have since returned to Aura Yoga for 4 other classes, (a second with Nikka, and others with Jake and Claudia) and though they are all different from one another, they are all superb.   The instructors and front desk people have none of that phony new-age sweetness nor the holier-than-thou, snooty judgementalism that I've encountered on occasion at other places and find so off-putting.  And parking is a cinch, with an ample free lot right on site.  If Yelp gave more higher than 5 stars, I would give Aura Yoga a six.  This place is very special.",O6TY0kPZlxzFyFRB0LOC4Q,Holly C.,90069

Through Moksha I had a transformation not only on the physical side (I lost 30 pounds through daily practice over a three month period, with a regular diet to boot, nothing special) but I enjoy the meditative aspects that they introduce into the class as well. I am excited about the studio's launch in LA and welcome another opportunity to continue my practice when I travel to sunny Cali!",ar_J5aYsH87vaRVzg8EYAg,djeddiej A.,90036

I was greeted warmly at the front desk. $20 seems high for a drop in class, but I was desperate for a class after a stressful 5 days away from home. The heat was tolerable, and about the level I am used to. They request that there is no talking in the studio except for instruction. I do get annoyed at coming in to a studio to settle in to my practice, only to be annoyed by a couple of girls next to me yammering on about something stupid. But perhaps just asking folks to speak softly would suffice? People were whispering a bit before the instructor came in anyway. Also there is no music, but to my surprise I really didn't miss it. The class was a great flow of movement and breath, with appropriate space for slowing down the breath and re-centering. A pet peeve of mine is when instructors talk through most of Savasana- this was kind of the case tonight. But I really liked Deena and her class. Would definitely come again!",nQz5dzTj4rU91uexJrzKWA,Christine B.,90036

I did, however, want to keep going to hot yoga. So I googled ""hot yoga"" and found Moksha. First thing, liked the website a lot. It answers a lot of questions before your first visit. The studio itself is great starting from a very friendly front desk staff which is usually the instructor and one other person. The practice room is amazing in that there is zero odor. The floor is made of cork and it makes such a difference. What drove me away from Bikram after one class was the odor from the carpet in the practice room. Maybe it was just that one studio but still... MYLA has a variety of class choices in terms of type and length of class. The instructors I've had so far have been Ezmy, Joe, Sim and Matt. I like all of them. I don't choose a class for a particular instructor. My choice is based on schedule. But I appreciate every instructor I've had so far has been incredible. The only downside to MYLA is the parking or lack off. It's generally street parking. They have a deal with Ca'Brea bakery next door but the one time I tried to park there, they were not accepting people for Moksha. Haven't tried to park there since but will need to do so now that it's getting dark earlier at night. Overall, I'm a satisfied Mosksha student/practitioner.

Modo has set my personal bar for quality of instruction, rigor, professionalism and quality of facilities so high, that I seldom find an equal on all fronts.  I miss you you guys.  Shout outs to Carolina, Joe, Emily, Ezmy (i know she moved), Dalton, Grant and of course, my main man, Gideon!",HecL3gSwQyXdKjfiyKBrpw,Seith M.,90036

So I told her I was told by friend that Friday nights were a donation class so I'm prepared to give a donation. She's like oh...well unfortunately I can not let you in because the instructor has already gone in. I'm like but I'm only 2 minutes late, I drove 30minutes is it possible to make an exception this time. She's like No. I only wonder if I would've said yes I paid for this class if I would've been allowed in. Disappointed I sat on the bench and contemplated my next move because my friend and I were supposed to catch up after the class. I was then greeted with a huge roach. Maybe it came from outside but either way how gross! The lady gave me a card for a free class and I kindly said thank you but I will not be back.

This studio has no respect for it whatsoever and doesn't include it in class. Instead the teacher has everyone lay down at the end of class, says namaste, and that's it. Class is over. No time built into class for savasana. Since this is LA, about 90% of the students are stampeding out the door as soon as class is over. Once eveyone leaves, if u want to stay and enjoy a savasana pose on your own, you can, which would be great!.... except.... the teachers think it's fun to blast BOTH the air and fans on at the end of class. So after u spend an hour building heat, you don't even have the option to have a savasana unless you want to lie there and freeze. It's so unplesant, not to mention, unhealthy. Your body is supposed to cool down on its own. Then to top it all off, the locker rooms are also freezing.",nHue_UES_bAHrmONvwqBkA,Chris F.,90036

LOL okay I guess she knows more about my life than I do. We insist this makes no sense to which she got aggressive. She points at me & says ""Well then you're expired too!""

I should give them 3 stars or more for their amazing instructors but realy when you end up with that nasty water dispenser after and hour and half hot yoga practice all your joy turns to something unwanted.

The mens locker area leading to the showers is quite narrow so that's a bit of a drawback but who cares. I can handle that. Parking is FREE too! Plus there are good looking people who come here which, let's be honest, doesn't hurt :)",8NTRlh_QSqOY_OfP7SyE6g,Karl W.,90211
,8383 Wilshire Blvd,4.0,Yoga,Hot 8 Yoga,283,5,,1/19/2013,"Went yesterday for a drop in and from desk to class it was better than expected. The reception was super friendly . I don't know what peoples expectations are , but the changing area , bathrooms( CLEAN !) and the juice bar are ,modern ,small and functional. No rocket science to understand a yoga studio with 3 separate studios inside. You come in , check in , change and go to your practice. In fact i liked it so much that in the middle of a VERY sweaty Yoga sculpt session with Cornelius ( great teacher btw) i was wondering why I have an expensive Equinox membership. I had a better workout on so many levels in one class,  than with my overpriced trainer. Parking is not easy , but then again its LA , give me a break. Will hit the month hard and see if quality will remain or go down the hill. So far its been a very pleasant surprise.",w0G_TNyF_sOAKZIf8vKG8w,Kristos T.,90211

Locker rooms are super clean, though I would say it can get very cramped if it gets busy which makes it really difficult to change and is probably the only downside to this place.

Today I tried Hot Yoga Sculpt and it was the most challenging class I've ever taken: the heat paired with cardio, weights and yoga. As someone who has long hated working out in the heat, I've come to embrace the benefits of hot yoga: my shoulders and hips are more open after 1 class than 5 non heated vinyasa flow classes.

Honestly  if you have experienced other yoga studios than you know that this place is top. At least to me it is and to many other friends of mine. since I came to USA this place was my permanent second home  After all there is a reason they named #1 studio. This place is super clean, have showers and trendy clothe to by if you forget your things or end up spontaneously in the area and decide to take a class. Lots of people in the front that try to help you out. Each studio has blocks and other things u might need to use. Teachers are great and fun. This place motivated me to live healthier life and be a better person. I have even took a Power Yoga trainings with Bianca at Hot8Yoga in Santa Monica. She is amazing teacher and she really truly knows and loves everything about yoga. She is very strong teacher even her beginner classes are not easy but she is make sure to keep you safe in every class of hers. I truly love her, she is personally one of my favorite teacher, I just wish my schedule match with here more so I can make to more  of her classes. If u thinking to go to this place, take her class and when u see her and her smile u will already feel comfortable even if u are a complete beginner and feel intimidated to take a yoga class cause u never done it before. It is really feels like Hot8Yoga is one big community, so much love, support, help, understanding and big friendship out there. I met owners, Vincent and Linda and I meet Linda sister, Lisa when i first time took class out there, and honestly they are so cool and great. I can't even tell you how much Vincent share with me and other people about yoga business which tell me he is not stuck up and his heart is really in the yoga world not just business. Lisa helped me out so many time and made me very comfortable when i was complete beginner and new to this studio. Come meet them when they out there, they are really cool and friendly. There are so many great teachers that I can't even name them all: Bianca, Deanna, Layna, Dekota, Rahm, Amanda, Marlize, Marja, some people I don't even know names but they are all so awesome in a different ways.

I ended up moving to Mid City West area and after searching online for yoga studios, I found this one and well the rest is history. Love love love! All of their classes are hot yoga in some form whether its fusion, yin, sculpt or regular hot yoga which is very similar to Bikram. The facility is so clean and nice, the studios are clean and smell nice, they have a cute area by the front desk that sells almost everything related to yoga including some refreshments.

She was beyond rude. As a professional ballet dancer, I know my body - and need brief moments of stretching. She called me out in front of the class and told me that I was only allowed to sit or to leave if I wasn't going to do exactly the postures (mind you she could barely even demonstrate anything herself).

Usually when I walk into a yoga studio (my regular place is the Hot 8 ktown location) I'm welcomed with smiles and a warm greeting. However, this lady was so cold and seemed to be in a rush to get back to her side work. She didn't even tell me which room the class would be in but I figured it would be easy to find out since they usually have signs on the doors. I was confused when I started looking for the class and it turns out none of the signs had been switched yet so I walked back to the desk and hesitantly walked up to the same girl to ask which room my class is in. I said ""excuse me I need some help"" and as she typed away on her laptop she didn't even look up and said ""what"". I was honestly so surprised by that answer because as someone who works in customer service I know when someone is trying to be plain rude on purpose!

They have a parking garage under the building which they will validate for 2 hours so that's great! The amenities feel like a spa. They have showers, shampoo, conditioner, tampons, q tips...! So the first class I took was Hot Power Fusion which I guess is that standard hot yoga class. I went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't very crowded. What I didn't realize about these classes is that the teacher doesn't do it along with you at the front. They just walk around the room and say what you're supposed to do. Sometimes it's nice because it avoids you constantly looking up, but it can be challenging if you're new and not sure what you're doing. The class was fine and you pretty much hold different poses. The second class I tried was Yoga Vibe. This was a very fast paced class. Everything was do able the pacing was just super fast. I happen to like it but I can see it not being for everyone. The last class I tried was the Sculpt class. That was my favorite! I think this place is $150 a month unlimited and this class really got me thinking if I should sign up. I feel like I could see this class transforming my body. I went to a weekday class at 6:15 and it was super crowded mat to mat. I can see why now. You use blocks and hand weights for some of the time, and it's very fast paced and challenging. During the workout I could really see myself feeling more toned.

Also, not sure how the women's experience is, but the men's locker room is unbearably small. The area with the lockers is tiny and is the hallway to the showers so after a crowded class, there is literally a line to get into the showers. They must do something about the locker situation. Also, since this is in Beverly Hills, it feels like the place very entitled people come to do yoga.

I now go to a far infrared studio, which is a lot cleaner, not over heated, and the instructors seem to be more knowledgable. I know Hot 8 has this negative attitude towards infrared.. but I come from a family of scientist and yes straight infrared isn't good.. but far infrared is great.

Let's first start off with the good. When you first come in, it looks very clean, nice and modern inside. Because it was my first time at hot8yoga, they provided me with a free bath towel since I didn't bring my own, which normally costs $2, so that was nice of them and they validate your parking for two hours. Also, there is no need to bring a lock since the locks are built in the locker. Now the bad thing about this studio is the women's locker room, it's too small for having three studios, there's not enough space to change or enough showers. There was a wait to get changed and to have a shower. Secondly, which is the reason why I'm never coming back there again is there is this awful unpleasant smell coming from the floors of the studio. The floors aren't your typical yoga floors, it's some kind of mesh flooring that soaks up everyone's sweat and that's why it's so smelly, which made it difficult to focus in class.

Also take this class if you need to fine-tune your practice. When you're ready, do not miss Francesca's classes. Get to the studio early because her class fills up quickly. Her dialogue leaves you inspired and you really push yourself to your limit and just beyond. I've also tried other classes:barre, sculpt, yin, to name a few. Definitely recommend mixing up the classes. Just when you think you're strong, you take Antwan's barre and realize you don't have any core strength. Beyond the aesthetic of the studio and their commitment to cleanliness, the members bring such good energy to the studio that it's a pleasure to be there.

My insight comes from a yogi that has been practicing for over 10 years and who is also a teacher. In the mist of a city that offers several styles of yoga, Modo has developed a community that is supporting and neutering. Here's what you should know..Modo is a sequence practiced in a heated room, while the modo flow classes switches it up a bit you'll still find yourself practicing the same poses just not in a rigid format. If you're looking for something that is traditional ashtanga based, with the opportunity to do inversions you won't find that here. Not because the teachers aren't qualified to teach it.. but the classes are so packed there's no room to really do that. ",lZuqmd5z2dEkJ3fG2pW53w,Alexis F.,90036

Don't love it, but it's good in a pinch if you want to sweat.  They have showers, lockers, and two large yoga rooms. A few of the challenges, are: no parking, and a very slippery floor. I stepped off my mat and fell flat on my face. There's got to be a better non slip floor option, the floors are drowning in sweat after all. Lastly, no one's ever gone out of there way to be that friendly to me there...the teachers, the front desk, or the students. They're definitely nice enough, as no one has been rude, but they're not that warm or friendly which is unfortunate for a yoga studio. For example, the three times I've been there, the instructor of the class checked me in, but didn't introduce themselves. If you know someone is new in your class (because you've never seen them before), and you know they're taking your class (because you checked them in) say hi, welcome them, and introduce yourself!

I went this past Sunday thinking I'd get a great workout in, to find out that the class was overbooked/packed to the point where it was bursting at the seams. I was up against a wall with very little room to fully move and get the full benefits of yoga. I was basically hitting other sweaty students. ick ick ick!!!  Although the instructor (Chip), walked around the class, he was barely corrected anyone in class (with the exception of his regulars). I know I could've use some correcting but he walked right pass me and said nothing. Not the place I'd want to practice as new yoga student. I made it known too that this was my first class at the front desk upon entering. But after class no one said anything - how did you enjoy the class or do you have any questions, etc. Just not a very warm (no pun) atmosphere to practice something like yoga. I won't be back.

I just moved apartments to the west side and luckily Modo West is 10min from my house. I've attended a few classes so far at West and have enjoyed the classes. I wish there were more classes offered throughout the day like La Brea but the studio is smaller with only 1 studio (although twice the size). I hope Dalton and April make guest appearances at the West studio. But I will continue to go to both as I work close to the La Brea location.

Taking classes with Carolina, Emily, and Dalton has been quite mesmerizing, to say the least. Having only done yoga at CorePower studios prior to my visit, yoga was more a workout I was looking forward to (sometimes replacing my daily visit to the gym.) My first class here was silent, which was already a new thing to me since all the classes I had taken at CorePower were with music, although this studio also offers classes with music. This made me somewhat uncomfortable at first, which I thought was bad, however, it is only when you find comfort in the uncomfortable when one feels most at peace (at least in my opinion.) Needless to say, I allowed my uncomfortableness to take over and enjoyed the flow one breath at a time. After the first class, I was hooked and have been enjoying it ever since. Modo is a lifestyle and it welcomes all. I recently visited the studio and Paris, which also took me in with open arms, and although I only know a speck of French, the instructor was nice enough to translate some of the sequence in English (shout out to Ludovic!) For those looking for a new studio or a new mental and physical release, sign up for Modo because the introductory month is affordable and more than worth it.",FbYyyHU1BakNfdTkym0LaA,Jairo M.,90036

You do camel pose but you don't follow with a forward bend like rabbit pose. It's unbalanced. The amount of variation in the series is too much and it's leading to a weak practice. I see a lot of regular practitioners wiggling and trying to get very deep in the pose without having the right form. I will say I do enjoy that there are some vinyasa flow elements to the practice,  in Bikram we never do down dog up dog. However Vinyasa was not designed for such a hot room. Additionally everybody is placed very close together in the small rooms and it creates a lot of humidity ( read: sweat )  and about 45 minutes in you question whether this was a good idea or not.",B-tPhyGT1LSH7jiXS7_FQw,Pinky L.,90036

Good yoga studios are a haven in the big city, a place to sooth your soul and get fit at the same time~which pretty much makes them worth a lot more than what classes cost. We attended a sound bath with Grant last week. He led us all in some movement work to get our bodies into a calm (sattvic) state, and then played singing bowls after we were lying down. Our group included a couple of experienced meditators, and all agreed that they had a deep meditation. A good sound bath like this one leaves you feeling refreshed, energized and clear-headed. Although we live closer to Modo Yoga West, we will most certainly try their regular classes. We highly recommend Modo Yoga.",F4S857x3zuQzRFVjJsV6aw,Skypp C.,90036

I signed up for the $50 unlimited for 30 days intro rate (I know, ambitious) so I'd be locked into a goal. I'm now looking forward to going (every other day) and every teacher I've had so far have been really incredible.

I will admit I have done a lot of yoga -- including Bikram -- so was a little hesitant to return to ""hot yoga."" However, I decided I would try it out. Turns out ""hot yoga"" is not quite as hot or difficult as bikram, at least here and at least in the class we did. In fact, I did not have to take any breaks and did pretty awesomely on the poses (if I do say so myself). And the instructor is a little kooky, which makes the class hippie and hipster all at once in a fun sorta way. Follow that up with a decent locker room, reusable metal water bottles you can borrow (so as not to drink the crap released by warm plastic bottles) and towels and mats you can rent, and this place gets my vote for yes. The only thing I will mention is that, although it's great that they have lines on the floor so the folks who typically put a huge buffer around themselves cannot, I did officially get hit in the head by someone's butt during class because it's a touch too close...

So I signed up for the beginners class in hopes of getting better alignment and form tips from the instructor. I took a class with Lauren and it was just odd how cold and disinterested she was. First, she arrived to class late, totally unapologetic. She didn't ask any of us if we had prior injuries or what level we were at with pilates. She just stated, ""you've all done a class with me."" Then she just started the class in a very cold and abrupt manner. And she started doing the pilates moves with us the majority of the class in an empty reformer. And she kept yelling out, ""great job everyone"" or ""you're all doing great."" How can she say that when she's on the reformer lying down and can't even see me? I was really hoping for some attention to detail on my form and alignment, but all I got was how to put the box away correctly off the reformer. It's actually slightly comical. I am definitely coming back to this studio because of location, it's clean and I really like the other instructors.

The studio is new, clean with only eight reformers which guarantees a great hands on session AND they have a filtered water station!!! The other reason why I love this place is because of Lauren Kokenes. Lauren is a very well trained instructor...she is patient, knowledgable, and is very big on making sure you are always using the proper form. Her classes are challenging and empowering, she always makes personal adjustments for each student based on height & skill level which is not something I find with other studios. I have been taking her classes regularly for the past five months and I'm amazed of my progress.

I'm not into outing poor instructors, so I won't name names (starts with an L, in case you'd like to pick a better instructor). It is very possible that the instructor was having a bad day judging by her unhelpful attitude and bad vibe, but she was barely civil to a few of the attendees, much less friendly, as one would expect for a relatively nice fitness boutique. I understand having a bad day, but pull yourself together and at least act like a professional when needed. ",lAU3T0DTx6Tnumkt74XQeg,May C.,90004

I've taken classes with most of the instructors but Nikka is one of my favorites. She offers just the right balance of vigorous, yet calming exercise I look for. Nikka is also great about making important adjustments and following up on them later in the class to make sure they're understood. The parking at the facility is also a huge plus as this has been quite problematic for me in the past in terms of getting to classes on time (especially in rush hour traffic).

Some are more 'yogi' (for lack of a better term- and that is not a put down) than others. Some are more about the workout that yoga provides while others incorporate more of the spiritual side as well as the workout.

I didn't intend to fall in love when I purchased a pass, but as they say, it happens when you least expect it! What tipped me over was today when I accidentally booked a class that was supposed to be for the following week. Despite my boneheaded mistake, the Aura team was super understanding (thankfully given that I noticed about a minute after) and made the switch for me. While other studios would've probably said too bad so sad, Aura is run by real people who go the extra mile!

The up-side? Energetic instructors, great music...the downside? The room is not kept cool enough to really be able to work out to your full potential and not almost feel heat-exhausted. I have a theory-they keep it hot so that you think you are working out harder than what you really are. All those beet-red, sweaty faces after a 45 min spin workout? Should not be the case-cool off the room and let the cyclists work harder to get themselves sweaty.... my experience was it's not THAT tough, and the class is too short at 45 minutes. Second, the music is ear-damagingly loud and there is no reason for that. I wore the earplugs as after a class at the We-Ho location I had buzzing in my ears for 2 days! Lastly, far too expensive and the ""arm moves"" while on the bike are silly. But then again I am a bit of a purist in wanting this to be a true cycling workout, not weight-lifting on a bike.

Though I had a 21-year meditation practice under my belt, I was all over the place, trying somehow to hold onto my precious life, even when it was so hard, and I wanted it so badly. I learned breathwork at another studio, which subsequently closed down, and moved over to the Den, where I met Rebecca. Like many others, I wondered about practicing this weird, intimate modality in a crowded room of strangers with an admittedly (her words, not mine) ""loud, passionate Italian woman"" coaching us over cranked-up music. But to say that it cracked me open like nothing else is an understatement. To say that it healed me sells it short. Today I'm here, I'm healthy, and I'm massively grateful to Rebecca and her huge heart, for everything she's done for me.

I loved the space and the cafe. Today, I was stuck in traffic and very hungry. I was stopped right next to Wanderlust and decided to go in to get a quick drink from the cafe considering I had a good experience before. I park and ask the attendant if I needed to pay if I was just going in to get a drink. He said ""You can ask to get a stamp inside and you will be fine."" Great. So I go in and look at the menu to see what I want. The barista says that they were closed at 4. It was 4:05. I asked if I could get a muffin and he said that was ok so I proceeded to pay for the muffin. As I'm about to pay, 2 girls come behind me and ask for drinks. He says ""we're closed"". But then proceeds to say ""well, what kind of drinks do you want?"" As if we were about to take their orders. He was unwilling to take my drink order but changed his mind once these two girls showed up. I called it out and he asked if I wanted to order a drink too (to cover his mistake). I had already payed for the muffin, so I said no. I go to the front desk to get the stamp for parking and the woman says I had to pay $4. The only reason I even went in there was because the parking guy said it would be free with a stamp so this was upsetting especially after the situation I had at the cafe. I go back outside and tell the parking man that they said I had to pay and asked why he told it would be free. There's an older man there with him and the old man starts to very rudely tell me that I should've read the sign and that it wasn't his problem. The parking guy did not defend me. So at this point I am very upset, almost to the point of tears. I go back to the front desk and pay for the parking. I explained to her the cafe situation and she did try to console me and even apologized for the parking situation. Thanks. Then I felt.

It's not just about doing poses and strengthening your body, but really improving your emotional state as well. Its welcoming, fun, and I feel great after I leave. All the staff there are lovely.

Love that there is a cafe with a great menu. Few bugs to work out though.. I have to knock some because of it being overpriced (outside of the new client special, which is only 1 month long), and because of the snotty staff. In a yoga studio I love to feel safe and empowered, especially by fellow females. I rushed across town to make it to a soul revival class I heard good things about, only to discover it was dreaded street cleaning on half the streets surrounding the studio and had to drive around for over 15 minutes. Finally find a spot , really needing a breath and solid practice at this point, walk in exactly ten minutes behind schedule which is pretty common in LA, especially at a place with no parking lot. I have to greet the host myself (backwards?). She then responds with a passive aggressive fake smile while letting me know I'm just a ""little"" too late, that there is a ten minute grace period. Would have been nice to know this, I wouldn't have wasted time driving around in circles for parking determined to try out the class. Hate to have one rude staff member ruin my experience, so will finish out my month and be sure to be early and speak to one of the kinder hosts who doesn't mind doing their job. (Kudos to one named Constance, I believe, who always gives me a warm welcome and is helpful!)

This is my all time favorite yoga studio. During a recent visit to LA I jumped to the opportunity not only to join a yoga session but to spend the day at this beautiful space. Yoga and meditation studio/cafeteria/shop, Wanderlust has it all and gets it right. The beautiful three story building in the middle of hectic Hollywood Is a nourishing place. Wanderlust offers a wide diversity of class styles and it is also a place to gather and explore. My favorite class is Soulscape (preferably at the Greatest Space -an expansive room) which is a collaboration between yoga instructors, musicians and DJs sharing their talent to align live music with breath and yoga moves. The menu at the cafeteria is not big but the food is good, there are plenty of healthy options and they rotate constantly so there is always something new. There is a patio area with small tables as well as community tables and even a hammock to chill. They keep the shop well stocked with yoga apparel and props, jewelry and self help literature. On this particular day I went there for lunch, worked all afternoon from the patio and did some yoga. I left Wanderlust feeling energized, happy and thankful.

I was worried about it bc 1. I hate being hot and 2. I am a newbie, and this was a level 2 class. Still, I figured it was more realistic to try it, rather than an afternoon class, bc if I made this a regular practice, I would be going in the morning. First off, I Loooove this space. I found street parking easily that early in the morning (free) and the receptionist said that the parking lot next to the studio doesn't often start charging until after 8:30-not quite sure about that-but would be nice if it's always true. The parking is actually $4, not $3 (as many have said) unless you're a member, and you validate. I parked for free on a side street and walked, but I think the metered parking looked mostly empty that early in the morning anyhow, so that's $2 for 2 hours...another tip, don't arrive earlier than 6:30 at the earliest, bc the front desk doesn't open until more like 6:45 for the 7 am class. I don't know why Yelp says they open at 6-that's false. Also, the cafe doesn't open until 8 am, and unfortunately it looked like the service was a bit slow this morning...so after perusing the very cute gift shop-- I just left. It looked like ordering something was going to take too long and they weren't quite set up yet at 8 am. The roof patio upstairs was adorable, and they have a nice eating patio outside too. Honestly, the downstairs studio space was what really sold it to me. It was stunning, with gongs, ariel stuff, and a gem alter. Huge too. I would love to do a sound bath there. As far as my hot yoga class, the studio was smaller, on the 3rd floor, and I felt very at ease, despite the 90 degree temperature, and the level 2 status. I felt it was easy to follow along, and just watch others when I was confused. I don't practice yoga regularly, but I have enough of a background (and have had it incorporated into enough barre classes) to follow along easily. The instructor was helpful with corrections, and I appreciated that she did a blessing to the victims of today's shooting. I love it when people are paying attention to the world, inside-and out. Thanks for a great class, Christina!",aUdTOflTR7hTib8ioqjX-A,Jillian C.,90028

We initially met with Melanie to get to know one another, and even though we'd talked to other Doulas, we instantly knew she was the one. In the meeting she was open and receptive of our views, patient, encouraging and knowledgeable; all of which continued throughout the process. We meet a few times in person prior to the birth, a check up of sorts where we bonded as a unit - this proved to be invaluable once L&D was in full effect. She also provided advice on exercise, breathing and focus techniques. 2 weeks prior to our due date Melanie and I communicated frequently, she answered our questions and helped to put us (me) at ease - of course, I was a week late and I began to get even more nervous.... then the day finally came and contractions started in the middle of the night, you think I'd know I was in labor but still through the pain I was so confused, was I in labor or not??? Melanie to the rescue - she reminded us that this was all normal and part of the process. I labored at home as much as I could, she came over to assist once I was fully on - my husband and I felt at ease that we had someone on our side, without her we probably would have ran to the hospital at first sign of a contraction..I arrived at the hospital at 7 centimeters.. I don't know how I did it but I did.. Once it was time, it was Melanie's time to shine - she was absolutely amazing always attentive and caring, she helped to keep me focused and encouraged me when I doubted myself. It was a long labor, we were all tired but she stayed to make sure he latched. Our last in-person meeting a few days post partum was emotional and seeing her again concluded what I now consider a beautiful chapter in my life.

I got a groupon deal for the body wrap because I wanted to get ready for coachella this weekend coming up. Luckily I didn't schedule away before I have to leave because look what happened!!! The session started and the guy said he was going to put it for 100 degrees for about 15minutes and come back to lower it down.... More than 15 minutes goes by and I have not heard or see anyone come by and check on me. I was feeling a bad burn and was telling myself maybe he'll come back soon he just forgot. 30 minutes passes by and it's at 100 degree and now I'm feeling a serious burn:( i was reading the machine and it specifically said do not leave it for 100 degree for that long and leave the client unattended. So I took the initiative to lower it MYSELF and it also stated on the machine to only put it between 70-80 for optimum result no where it say to put it longer than 15minutes! This is when I knew customer service her must suck for being unattended like this. He comes back 5 minutes before my session to finally check up..: I told him I was burning and I had to MYSELF lower the machine down. He seemed like he didn't care and just said ""oh yeah it gets hot"" really? So if I didn't lower it myself i would be burning 100 degrees for one hour.. Let the photos speak for itself...

Unfortunately,  it's gone downhill since.  I've been through the wave of the studio's overhaul. Lightbulbs finally replaced,  cushion covers are replaced, they are wiping down the mirrors now but still not enough between classes. They finally replaced the carpet after months and months of everyone complaining. However,  they chose the cheapest quality of carpet possible and feels less than 1/4 of padding underneath as from their previous carpet.. Your feet slide during exercises even with the expensive socks on that they sell. When kneeling down for certain exercises, It feels like your doing it on cement.  It hurts :(( For some reason,  a lot of the original instructors have moved on and the instructors now are all the same in personality and character.  Even with the variation of classes I feel like I'm doing the same exercise over and over just a different day and time. So frustrating,  haven't been excited or enthusiastic to go for a long time now.  My friends are saying the same things. It has lost the prestige overall.

Minutes into the class I already felt the heat turnin' up! One of my biggest complaints with Bar Method, etc is I don't feel like I am really working.  Physique 57 integrates some cardio along with weighted exercise and pilates/bar moves. For me integrated classes have always been the most effective. I am most definitely a fan of Physique! Bonus factors: they offer a couple comped classes for thos who work in the area, and they have a few great intro specials. And the staff is super sweet.  Kimberly is so good that I am going to try a private with her as well.  In the class situations she takes the time to individually assist all the students and with her long, lean frame she is the perfect role model!

I never write yelp reviews although I read them all the time, so Physique 57 is obviously worth the time. The instructors are total pro's, incredibly upbeat with positive energy and they make sure they know your name (small detail, but an important one!). Love that some of the classes also have 2 teachers so that 1 can instruct while the other walks around correcting your form. I did the Newcomers Special here & I've done monthly packages at Pure Barre and The Bar Method also, going 4-5 times a week, and I def feel the strongest after Physique. It was the most physically challenging, the cleanest with the easiest (free) parking, but it was also the most fun. Bar Method is great, but the slow paced music sometimes isn't enough to power through. The mixes in Pure Barre can be repetitive, they don't switch playlists/songs enough, and the plastic bands and self wipe mats are def less luxe than Method or 57. I would subscribe to Physique 57 unlimited every month if it were more affordable - if they dropped to closer to $200/225 per mo I'd rationalize the splurge to myself, and think I'd have to plan ahead to sign up for a spot in the class like you do at Bar Method where the classes always seem to be at capacity b/c a lot of other girls would too.

When I was doing Bar method they only had a regular and an advanced version of the same class. Often there wasn't that much difference, depending on the teacher. Exhale had a bit more variation and started introducing different class types while I was there. Both of these studios I would recommend, both have quality teachers and good classes. But then I discovered Physique 57. I took the first class in NYC  and then started taking class in Beverly Hills. I believe their classes are a step up from all the other Barre studios that I have tried. They have a variety of classes that are really different in structure and they change the different exercises and sequences every 6 weeks or so. At the other studios I got bored and could do the classes in my sleep, here they literally keep me on my toes and I never get bored. The advanced version truly is an advanced version and not depending on the teacher. Also unlike the other studios it seems they prefer professional dancers as teachers and I find them very, very knowledgeable when it comes to dealing with injuries etc. ",wjnPfoz7aVm11eu4LGMN7Q,Alex H.,90210

I was so happy when Physique opened here on the west coast.  I was a major devotee back in New York City and tried to find a worthy alternative when I moved to LA.  I tried Bar Method, Cardio Barre, Pop Physique.  All offer a very good workout that is low impact and will strengthen muscles you probably didn't know you had.  Barre classes are terrific full-body, strength training workouts, that help with balance, prevent osteoporosis, and can even rehab injuries by stretching while you tone and strengthening your core. But I couldn't help feeling like I needed a run after those other workouts. They just aren't quite enough for me to feel really worked. So I ended up spending more time at bootcamp and crossfit classes.  That is, until Physique followed me here. At Physique the pace will keep your heart muscle pounding, too.

The teacher didn't talk about form at all - even basics when stretching or doing plies - and I saw many classmates asking for injury. The same goes for the tricks we were doing - the teacher wasn't particularly clear on what we were doing or how to do it and a lot of the class looked confused.

And the gate to enter the lot has a 4 digit passcode that they've failed to communicate anywhere on the site or Classpass. They don't even pick up their phone. I've called several times because I couldn't find the lot or even the place rather, but noone picks up. So unless you're psychic to guess the code right, and have alot of free time on your hands to just circle around the block 7 times guessing which parking lot is theirs, this place is a total waste of time. Arriving at the place should not be this difficult so right off the bat that's a -10. I get there and they say grip socks are required to enter class which they follow up with saying they could be bought for $14 which is pretty ridiculous.  They should've been more flexible with first timers but they weren't and sent me home without any questions asked and that was my first class. Don't waste your time here. There's far better pilates places with quality instructors, who are far more friendlier, give you the utmost convenience for the money you pay, give out socks to rent to make it easy, and just simply far better customer service.

I was struggling, and the guy was also.  The teacher kept demonstrating things that no one (not even the girl who was really good) could do (and yes, it was amazing to see her do that... but I wasn't there to ""watch"").  Eventually she did help me and the guy modify some of the exercises, but in general I didn't feel that was she really paying attention to the class until we were about 35 min in, then she began to notice I wasn't able to do some of the exercises.  I've taken classes at 2 other studios, and most teachers seem to be pretty aware of beginners and really helpful, so this class pissed me off!  As a result, I'll never go back there, which is too bad, since I'm sure there are other teachers who are much better... but I'd rather find a studio where ALL the teachers at least pay attention to the students.",dqLhJkeSbu5J1KHKyD-QZg,C O.,90028

Having the Yelp deal made it easier in the beginning. Whether I'm stressed, run down, feeling bloated, cramping from womanhood or needing to clear up my skin- the infrared helps to relieve tension and clear out the heaviness. The Sweat Shop LA is clean and always on time. Parking can be tricky since it's a highly populated area in Hollywood, but there have been times when the girl behind the desk offers to tack on an extra quarter to my meter 10 minutes before it ends. There are showers in each little room and drinking water provided. When I'm done with one jug, I like to keep hydrated, I set it out in the hall and they bring another. They offer mineral shots at the end which I do and a friend of mine really enjoys the cayenne shot before going into the sauna. There are a few rooms with diagonal metal beams that will almost allows give a bump to the head, but I think they've padded those by now. There is a fairly pricey, but fantastic raw food shop connected to them and it's nice to indulge in the goodness afterwards. I like Sweat shop for convenience, accuracy, ambiance and intention. ** They also allow walkins when there is room-- the option to call in when needed and just show up is HUGE and so nice :)",kKQIrBCTMsYHGbfW3I2LuQ,Jess ..,90028

Before this they usually check u in fast, get in, get out, the shot itself only takes a minute. Max time: 5 mins. But today was a whole different story, came in for my 4th lipotropic injection, approached the receptionist (haven't seen her, must be new) and told her what I was in for, she jotted my name down and told me to sit down and they'll call me. So.. I was waiting.. Waiting.. And waiting.. 30 minutes passed by, nothing!! I was sitting infront of the counter, impossible not to be noticed. So I approached the lady in the counter (a different one by now), and I asked if they had a tech available cuz I've been waiting for 30 minutes. And let me tell u, parking is so hard to find, to be dealing with this. So I told her that I spoke to the other lady, and said, well, she just came in, blahblahblah, turns out, the tech who was gonna administer my injection was the one who neglected me in the first place!! And gave me some lame excuse that she got sidetracked by her boss asking her to do some inventory. Really?? Inventory vs Customer? When all this time she was just chitchatting with her friend who visited. My goodness, if you're gonna be racist and don't want to do anything, then don't come to work at all!! Bad, bad, business.

He has an incredible way of combining breathing and just the right workout for every individual, and he switches it up so that some days you lift weights and some days you kick the crap out of a punching bag. Scott helped me with diet, mental changes and obviously physical changes. You can see my transformation in his photos. After about 8 months working with Scott, I had lost a total of 70 lbs, and gained lean muscle and the learned to eat the right way. If you want to make a serious change, at a VERY reasonable price given all of the training and certification he has, this is it.

He gives me a good ass kicking, but is sensitive to what my body needs and when I need to slow down or take it easier. He's even set up workouts for me to do on my off days and he gives me nutritional guidance as well, which is just as important as the workouts. He's also just an all around nice guy and helps you prepare your mind not just for the workout, but for life. I'd highly recommend him to anyone!

I'd just say be careful with the twisty moves - where your upper body twists to the right and lower body to the left - especially if you're susceptible to back injuries. I'm in really great shape - take spin Pilates and barre classes usually 5 days a week and also teach yoga and barre myself - so I'm by no means out of shape, but still got injured. So just be careful and take it easy maybe on your first class. The class is very high impact and maybe my body just isn't used to that - tho I did ballet for years and we do plenty of jumps and I never injured myself there.

Love all the classes, but definitely will be back for the trampoline class, I could not find anything like it in SF just yet. I will try their New York studio soon, cant wait!!

I'm fairly new but I love this place. The trampoline class is a great cardio work out that you can smile and laugh through as there is something very nostalgic about jumping on a trampoline. I love the full body and HBT classes as well. I particularly like Nicole's taste in music and her classes. I hope they add more trampoline classes in the morning and full body in the am since I have to be at work by 9 and a lot of their classes end at 9. otherwise, LOVE!",fUihiZLf0cYs0YaAgmLF5w,Esther S.,90069

It's not good for some people, for the record. But it's good for me. I like having my own private sweat shop where I can just listen to a podcast (pro-tip: bring your own bluetooth speaker and put it on the floor where it doesn't get too hot) and detox. Sometimes I like to drink tequila while I'm in there, just to see if it just immediately sweats out and I don't get drunk. Turns out it doesn't work and I do get drunk and it's embarrassing. That only happened four times, though. So the tequila thing was an amateur-tip. Here are two more pro-tips: 1) make sure you shower after, you just sweat out a whole bunch of stuff--wash it off, homie. There's another sweat place that recommends not showering for two hours later or something. Nope. Bad.  2) It may be the last thing you want to do, because you just sweat your genitals off, but--especially if it's cold out--wear a scarf at least on the way to the car. I got kinda sick a few weeks back because I did not adhere to this rule. You're very open after sweating like a mofo and the back of your neck is a place stuff--EVIL STUFF--can get in. So, yeah, bring a scarf. I do have one note: that online booking joint has never worked for me, or anyone I know, get rid of it. Still, five stars, because I'm sure you'll fix it. :)",KHsedNDVLjAZlNVKcm4tXA,Brian K.,90028

They provide you with all your necessities including organic shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion, hairties, make up remover... and a glass bottle full of water which they're happy to refill for you. You get an hour to use the room. Unlike a normal sauna, the infrared heats you from the inside and you sweat like crazy, but it's bearable. For your first time, it's recommended you stay in the sauna for only 35 minutes... I stayed in for 40. I felt super drowsy and weak as soon as I got out but 5 minutes later as my body adjusted I felt brand new! Bought the yelp deal ($115 for $150) so I'll be back for more sessions.

Not only do they care but they are well informed about wellness and if one person isn't too sure they find another worker or make calls to help get you an answer. I've had just about every shot (mostly B12) and the process is quick and to the point. You are in and out in no time! I believe they do walk ins but it's best to call!

I got a membership ASAP because I was going so often. The classes are amazing and range from yoga to TRX. The teachers are AMAZING. They are friendly, and take time to really show you how to do the different moves and positions. My two favorite classes are the hot TRX with Serryn and hot yoga with Ash. Very different classes but I love the TRX class because it whips me into shape and Serryn is such a good teacher. She's fun to be around and really knows what she is talking about and she's made me so strong! I didn't know what TRX was before her and she's made it so enjoyable that it's now my fave. Ash is the best yoga teacher ever, and I've tried a lot of yoga. Every time I leave her class I feel so much better about the day and life in general.

I was very pleased with everything they offered us from glasses of water to amazing smelling lavender cold face towels post sauna. It was a great day for us to pamper ourselves and relax! Inside the sauna both of us fit very comfortably and we even set up the Bluetooth speaker to play some spa music and it was heavenly. You sweat a lot but they provide you with many towels and you get to shower afterwards. We both felt renewed afterwards and loved every minute of the experience.

This review is for the yoga class, as I have not yet experienced the saunas or other offerings.  This studio is so cute, clean, and smells so good. I love the whole vibe, the crystals, the infrared heat, everything! I took Devan's Hot Power class and it kicked my butt! I practice and teach hot yoga regularly, and I absolutely loved her class. It was challenging and I felt amazing afterwards. I can't stop raving about it to my friends after my first experience. I would definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to come back. Parking can be a bit hectic in that area of Hollywood, especially depending on the time of day. I got lucky and found a meter right around the corner on Sunset in the late evening.

Been lucky enough to have tried all sorts of fitness classes like pure barre, cardio barre, kickboxing,  spin, crossfit, p90, insanity etc but spx (in combo with cardio) has given me the results most women seek In a short and focused amount of time. I'd say you should be able to see some significant results by your 12th class assuming you are eating healthy. Most see thinner limbs in the first few weeks, thinner waist and increased strength and flexibility.    ",zQmswcOJkRsXDavJpHuAQg,Schmeez E.,90028

,1330 N Highland Ave,4.5,Pilates,Pilates Platinum,117,1,Hollywood,3/27/2018,"Ugh where do I begin-- I HATED this class. H-A-T-E-D. I've taken hundred of different classes at tons of different studios and never hated one before this one. As soon as I walked in the door Mikael says ""have you been here before?"" I said ""No but I've done Pilates before"" he promptly informs me that they do NOT teach Pilates here. OKKKKKayyyyy... you might want to think about removing the word PILATES from the name of your business if that's NOT what you do. They teach Lagree whatever the eff that is. But ok Fine, I'm willing to try something new, but Mikael was clearly not interested in teaching. Even though there was only three other girls in class he was already visibly annoyed that I was new. He spent the next hour giving me half assed, barely intelligible instructions and then coming over to berate me when I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be doing. I'm not a workout newbie but you would think that if there was a new student you would try to give clearer instructions. After verbally berating me didn't seem to be working (because I couldn't understand what he was saying), he proceeded to roughly grab me and force me into the ""correct"" positions. I've been doing yoga and pilates for 15 years and have had a personal trainer so I'm used to having my form corrected, but I have never had a instructor grab me this way. When I told him I couldn't do a movement because there was too much resistance with multiple springs he looked me dead in the eye and said ""if you don't want to do it, don't do it"". Look dude, first of all, I didn't say I DIDN'T WANT to do it and second of all, what he EFF is your problem??? Most REASONABLE instructors would say ""ok why don't you try removing 1 spring and do the best you can."" That's ALL that needed to be said in that situation but instead he decided to get in my face about it. I came close to walking out right then and there. Never have I even contemplated walking out of a class but this guy was pushed me to the edge that much. I did my best (which apparently wasn't nearly good enough for Mikael) for the rest of class but I was counting down the minutes until I could put as much distance as possible between me and this horrible studio. Unless you are a ""Lagree"" expert or don't mind getting talked down to by someone that's too annoyed to HIS JOB, I would avoid this place like the plague.",RzWTHb2IIFEcQCK3CVQP2A,Amy S.,90028

I appreciate an instructor who takes time to correct my form and offers options for increasing or decreasing the intensity.

,1330 N Highland Ave,4.5,Pilates,Pilates Platinum,117,3,Hollywood,8/19/2018,"Angie was nice, lots of good burns in the hamstrings and core, but compared to SLT and Brooklyn Bodyburn, it wasn't that great (just moved here). It was more like traditional pilates, I think we only did 3-4 real Lagree moves. The machines were older megaformers that didn't have the moving bar used for extended skating or straps for balance on the front and back, which was weird to get used to. There were no handles on the front or back platforms either so I don't think this studio does a lot of mountain climbers and cardio bursts there. Music wasn't quite loud or energetic enough. I was going to go back a few times and give it another try but then when I asked if my son could sit against the wall with his iPad in the future (single mom life) they said no, and I only join studios that are family friendly like SLT was, so I won't be back.",dHGcxcusIBpCc1KsKQOkTw,Nicole D.,90028

Depending on the weather/time of week when they wash the silks, the hammocks can fell more slippery (this is a rosin free studio). There is a warm-up, then some conditioning on the hammock (step-ups, crunches, splits, leg lifts).  Then they teach you a ""trick of the day"" which Is a pretty basic aerial hammock skill.",0QWg3fr3krMQLg1eHs9Ajw,Marie H.,90048

Overall, I thought it was on par with Pure Barre, The Barre and BarreAmped in terms of types of exercises and intensity. Less arms than BarreAmped but worked with a higher weight. I just tried the Signature format for my first time. I liked that there weren't cues for lots of tucking the tail bone and seemed okay with performing exercises with a neutral spine. the cues around the tailbone seemed geared for alignment vs overtucking. Lauren, the instructor, did a nice job of giving corrections and checking in with form with all of us. Great energy too w/o being overly serious.

We really enjoy the spinning classes with Rick, Jody, and Amanda. They all are awesome people!! However, in my opinion they do need 2 pool lifeguards.  All they are doing is sitting around and talking. Today my husband and I were doing laps in the same lane and I gave my husband a small kiss on the cheek, and was told by the male life guard there I could not do that!! That is totally absurd, and when I questioned him about the silliness of this, he responded it offends the other people there?? Go figure!! I did not see a no kissing in the POOL RULES. Obviously, they don't have enough excitement in their life, and have too much time on their hands to worry about 50 yr olds sharing a tender moment!!! This is a free country!  I thought the YMCA was all about being loving, caring, and having a christian attitude!!",_99qYPFcMJzFPEm9Jt7gUg,Lynn W.,91502

I got lost my first time because it's located in the parking lot of Sunset Plaza. But parking in the back is free! The studio has juice served here (love!!!) and malin+goetz products everywhere. There are two restrooms in the back along with a reformer and jump board. Since there is one room it can get cramped between classes (people leaving and coming in). There are also lockers located in the back by the restrooms.  I've been here about 6 times and every time it has been a great experience. I can feel myself getting stronger compared to when I first attended class here. Greg is awesome. Now granted I have only had him and one other instructor but I will keep coming back to take his hot pilates class. It's tough.

Maybe it was an off day, I know the instructor was subbing in for the regular instructor so that may have been the reason. Anyway, the class didn't have the kind of flow that makes an hour fly by. The instructor kept pausing and thinking about what we were going to do next. At one point she said we only had 5 minutes of class left and began wrapping up class only to then correct herself because there were actually 25 minutes remaining. That's when she apologized and said she didn't really teach that class and that she was only filling in. Maybe that's why she didn't have the choreography down? I would expect a studio to either have a competent instructor or cancel/reschedule a class. I have attended sessions where an instructor in training is leading and that's okay too but you go in knowing that because the class is marked as such. This was no such class and it left my friend and I a bit unsettled since we take our workout time seriously. If we knew it was going to be such a wishy washy workout we probably would have gone elsewhere. ",-L9YrY3jfq2tOccs7oPb4A,Cindy G.,90069

Arielle also teaches a sculpt class that I would recommend as you start feeling stronger. The owner, Shannon also teaches a great booty class. All staff both in class and at reception are warm and friendly. Classes in the mornings and evenings Monday-Thursday and mornings Friday-Sunday. Also check out Arielle's theme classes where she does mash ups of pop stars including Britney vs Beyoncé and tlc vs salt-n-peppa",mqMeo-UenRzZQLyXuH-PFQ,Ana S.,90069

He taught in a way that I caught on quick, felt inspired, and left dripping sweat! The whole staff is so nice too! The veggie juice in front is yummy!

I cannot recommend coming here enough, they have an incredible deal for $100 unlimited month, which dedicating a 5 days a week for a month you're basically paying $100 for a completely new body. Arielle, Shannon& Shana are some of my most frequent instructors but there is not a single instructor there that I haven't taken and would personally recommend. I used to do Barry's Bootcamp and although the workouts were great, I tend to be very habitual and like to go to workout to mentally release at least 5xs a week and hot Pilates is the only thing I can do that frequently and not get even remotely bulky.

Also-- you have to bring your own mat -- where at other gyms they provide the mat and towel to you at no extra charge... Also, each student has to clean their mat off afterwards which I don't want to be doing when I am 1) super exhausted from class and 2) I don't trust other people to really ""clean"" 3) When you're paying this price for a class you would expect it to come w/ the cleaning service.

My family, mom dad and brother and all over 21 year old,  had family plan for more than a year at this ymca. My membership at La fit finished so i decided to get into our family plan. I checked the website and it says 2 to 6 adults for a family plan!!! We came here and the lady at the front desk denied it and said no only 2 adults and 4 under 18 kids!! I tried to explain that she was wrong because we had 3 over 21 adults already in our plan!!! Finally i realized talking to this rude emloyee is just a waste of time so i asked for manager. Then she said theres nothing that a manager can do that che cannot!!!moreover, she said ""why dont you get a seprate membership its only 30/month, is it too much for you? We can help u!""

I was worried because I didn't know what to wear or what to expect. I decided on sweat pants and a tank top. When I got there I was greeted by a nice man who signed me up, said ""first session is free"". Didn't seem to be concerned with selling me anything or even checking if I'd ever been there before or not, I liked the sense of trust there! As soon as I walked in the studio I could feel a very calming energy, and I don't usually believe in that sort of thing, but this place had a calming energy for sure!! The class was great! The instructor Christine Burke was her name I think had an amazingly relaxing voice, her tone was calming and soothing!! The class was intense, I'm in good shape but I was sweating like crazy. I've never sweat this much doing anything. Over all I felt welcomed, guided, and respected!! At the end of the session we laid down on our backs and relaxed and I could for the first time feel my blood flowing through my veins, I was aware of my hearts rhythm, I was aware of every sound in the room, and yet I wasn't distracted by any of them. Literally a religious experience for me, and I'm not religious. On my drive home I found myself feeling really happy, I was laughing out loud in my car for no reason, and when I got to my street, parking always is hell, as soon as I got in front of my house I noticed a parking spot!! I swear there's something to being happy and doors randomly opening for you!! I'm literally addicted after my first session! I love this place!!!

In fact, I have encountered many doctors who know very little about it.  She is certified in the Vodder method of manual lymphatic drainage, which is an extremely delicate and deliberate system of bodywork.  Xindi's background in nursing, Chinese medicine and acupuncture also really help to support her work.  Xindi is also committed to professional growth; at the end of this month she will travel to Dallas to attend the National Lymphedema Network conference.  I can't wait to hear about all she's learned there.  I count myself blessed and fortunate to live in Los Angeles and have access to Xindi's healing massages.  Living with lymphedema is not without its challenges, but knowing that I have Xindi makes it easier.  It is with great pleasure that I write this recommendation on Xindi's behalf; she is a real treasure.",WQzJm3Xe9vGyriyZfP1sBA,Tess D.,90019

Staff at the desk is friendly enough but not overly so. I never found that I was truly welcomed. Just someone to check off on the attendance list. The saving grace was class with Noelle she was probably the best yoga teacher that I experienced here. Her classes kick ass and she's awesome. Zero stars for Emilie Perz who technically seems like a sound instructor, but has a mean streak drill sergeant mentality. I've never taken a class where the yoga instructor calls you out in front of everyone for doing something that they ""think"" is wrong. I was doing an inversion on the wall in a way that was comfortable for me and apparently Emilie was not pleased. She proceeded to point me out in front of everyone and I found it pretty embarrassing even though what I was doing was totally fine. Experienced her doing this to someone else in another class. Not in the spirit of yoga at all.  Also the ""garden"" studio in the back is basically right by the driveway and alley and often you will experience the sounds of cars pulling out as you are trying to practice as well as garbage trucks and the like.

During the class she took the time with each one that I guess she knew to correct they posture and totally ignored me until 5 minutes before the class ended did she take the time to correct my posture.

There are several different levels of classes, and sometimes, even a mixture of them. I definitely prefer music without lyrics -- or at least English words that pull me out of whatever I'm working on. That is a rarity, in my experience -- however, that did happen in a mixed class I took last week. Akk. Other than that, things have been very peaceful and helpful.

Everything was just as beautiful as she described it. The garden studio was immaculate! Our instructor was Brittany and we absolutely loved her. Thanks Christine for making this a memorable experience. There was a group of 10 of us and even we though we don't live local, about an hour away, we agree that it was well worth the commute and we look forward to patronizing Liberation Yoga in the future.

My previous yoga teachers were all of the same mindset, trained in classical yogic principles and lived by what they taught. I like the idea of practicing yoga on a consistent basis to alleviate much of the tension and stress that accompanies the chaotic lifestyle I know and love (and sometimes loathe), and Liberation is the perfect place to do this in. It's nothing like a typical yoga class but more like your own space where you practice whichever yoga style suits you best. There are two separate spaces, the garden and indoor room, both of which are very pleasant to spend an hour and a half in. The couple that runs this studio are some of the nicest people around, which is another pro. Liberation is a place that can offer something more personal and homely.

At first I felt so out of place, but he was so helpful and hands on and knowledgeable about the clients and the practice. He came over and adjusted me or verbalize instructions to correct me or improve my pose and.. it was wonderful. Just to get a little TMI, his certainty/charisma/knowledge was quite arousing. I mean this man is maybe twice my age, but damn, he knows his sh*t and knows how to make other people sh*t better. Sh*t equates to practice and knowledge of the practice btw.

It's available very few hours daily . Super early when everyone sleep and when everyone on their job. The rest of the time they train high schoolers probably the town pay for it. So forget about the pool 2) you won't find many necessary equipment here. Some machine might be out of order for long (1-3 months). 3) employees working with kids in the play room don't love their work (except one awesome blond lady. She's super nice). 4) when I ask to borrow a jump rope they sometimes ask me to leave my id as a guarantee I bring it back .. very odd 5) most of the people don't know that they need to return weight and rerack their equipment (who cares ?) May be just too many young people who are not familiar with a gym culture ... This gym is in 3 min walking from my home - the only reason I'm still here. I'm moving out of the areas soon tho.

My kid freaked out, so we sat on the side of the pool with him to calm him down and try to get him back into the water, but then suddenly we're unceremoniously told we have to leave after the first five minutes - so basically our kid is either going to sit there on his own outside of the pool, scream his face off while in a deep ass pool, or go home. We went home. I put in for a refund and it took three weeks, an email, and five calls to get my money back because the woman who runs the swim department can't keep herself organized. Oh I should also mention that the instructor wasn't who we were told it would be, we never got a confirmation email about the class or if we were signed up, meaning we also had no idea how the class worked/what we needed to bring, and we still don't have a confirmation that the class was canceled, though I did JUST see the money go back into my account (a month later)",XYkSsovOjGD3Z6IudgHwMQ,Cindy L.,91502

They used to have some really great programs for youth and were well-staffed by friendly and helpful employees. Old heads will remember Amanda White's amazing spin class- they let a great thing get away. But I stuck around for the boxing club. Lately they seem to be more concerned with ""improving"" the aesthetic and less with member experience. They've reduced the amount of equipment available in the cardio room and as part of the recent upgrade. It was fine before, in my opinion. But change is inevitable. What can you do? What compelled me to write this review is that, although they close at 10pm, in the last couple of weeks staff has been shutting rooms down 10-15 minutes prior to get people out of the gym by closing (which still doesn't necessarily occur). I'd love to stop working 10-15 minutes early every day and start packing up so I'm out the door right when I'm off but the reality is I still have to answer calls and emails while I'm on the clock. I can't understand why it should be any different here. However, they're shutting lights off in the basketball court as early as 9:45 and in the cardio room as early as 9:50. Tonight Travis, the MOD, rudely chased myself and two other paying adult members out of the observation deck at 9:50 while we were stretching and doing floor work. When I inquired as to why, he was clearly irritated by my question. He was unpleasant as I tried to explain that because I come to work out later in the evening, that 10 minutes makes a difference to me and I've never been chased out of a room in that manner in the entire time I've been a member. I've been really happy to refer friends to the YMCA, especially for the boxing program, but if this is how you're going to start treating guests and cutting our workouts short, I wouldn't feel comfortable continuing to do so. This is why people are leaving the Y in favor of the newer gyms or Defiant. I understand and am leaving in that direction myself.",ShBTs59AtF4plOLYuglNRQ,Bree N.,91502

She makes the tough stuff less painful. I am not a born dancer or athlete I really struggle with a lot of the tiny details like pointing your toes or different grips and Bespun teaches you all those little things that make you such a better dancer.  There's always that one trick you think you'll never be able to learn and Bespun can make it happen for you.

I had an awful experience at this studio earlier this week. My roommate and I were eager to take a beginner level pole class (for context, we both have dance backgrounds and are not size 0 women) and unfortunately left before the class even began. From the second we walked in the door, we felt unwelcome in the space. We were met with silence and judging eyes from other class participants scanning our bodies up and down. We proceeded to put our stuff down and begin stretching despite the discomfort. The teacher, Wendy, came up to us and loudly asked if it was our first time here. We both responded with excited and eager yes's. Her face immediately scrunched up in disgust, she backed away a bit, and replied with a ""ooohhh...this is a climbing class so it'll probably be hard for you two to get yourselves off the floor"" while gesturing to us in a way that implied we were too fat to even try. I mentioned how the class was advertised as being ""good for beginners"" to which she snappily replied ""ADVANCED beginners."" I suggested that their website should specify that, and also elaborate on what exactly an ""advanced"" beginner class was. I then directly asked, ""are you saying we shouldn't be here?"" She shrugged and said, ""I meeeeeeaaaannnn... you can try if you want. But an intro class where you walk around and try to be sexy might be better suited for you two.""

We somehow got lucky and usually had smaller classes so we got more one on one time. Loved her! Than I had a class with Brynn, she was a fun fairy she was super nice, calm, and really talented also answered any questions and praised all attempts! My latest class was with Katherine and she's definitely more down to business, but that was also the largest class I attended. She definitely talked out each step the most and I found that super helpful! I don't know why I saw a few negative reviews, the staff always seemed super nice and after just the 1st visit the front staff always remembered my name.

I am the typical 6ft blonde model type who has graced many catwalks in my day, however doing a pull up or push up.. forget it. My strength has always been in my legs.. or so I thought until I walked in the door of Be Spun. I decided to go with private lessons because I REALLY want to learn and engage with the sport and instructor.. on top of that I didn't care to embarrass myself in a group.. So I browsed the web & found Be Spun. Right away from their website and videos I knew this was the place I wanted to start my journey. I called and was able to get a private lesson the same day & the instructor available that day was Wendy Lee. I can not tell you how comfortable & welcome she made me feel even tho I knew NOTHING about what I was getting myself into. If you are like me and HATE the gym.. let me tell you- Pole is all you need. It is an ENTIRE body workout and I have a completely new respect for these girls. The things they can do with their bodies takes incredible strength.

Yes it said ""beginners"" in the description, but not great for first timers. I did the warm up with the class and was fine then we moved to the pole and I was lost. The instructor noticed and came over quickly to give me and one other girl some modified moves. She was super sweet and gave us a rundown of other class that would be a better starting point.  She offered to continue to give us a modified workout and was very encouraging. I decided to step out of the class and reschedule for one of the Basics classes the next day.",_HgbjU_X4Ziumy4nPHVZOA,Molly K.,90046

Great deal I must say so myself, for $99 for eight weeks was a steal! The usual price for the workshops are around $320, so I'm sure you'd agree for that bargain. Anyways, it's a great experience with two awesome instructors and I'll tell you why I ended up with two instructors. First off, the first week was pushed back due to Easter Sunday and I had picked Sundays for my 2-hour pole dancing experience because of my hectic school/work schedule, but anyways, the first and last class was taught by Adrienne because Sienna wasn't able to make it. No problem, and she was sweet and taught us a thing or two, haha. As for my primary instructor, Sienna, she's an awesome and goofy teacher, love her! Learned a lot from all that she taught us and am continuing my training for her core workout and fun skills. Currently taking private lessons with Sienna and am planning to take Sienna for the advance pole fitness in the fall. I hope this encourages anyone who can't to try something new and you meet great people from learning an art form.",2EvJUZ7l9UE2iUIe4vz7Tg,Angela C.,90046

This studio is extremely overpriced, especially taking into consideration that when you take a 45 minute class, you will be sharing a pole with 1-3 other girls for the entire class. Pretty crazy, right? The place REEKS. You do floor work and stretches on these yoga matts that are likely ridden with crabs, as they don't get cleaned in between uses, and are literally blackened with sweat and dirt. (Remember, everyone is in tiny sweaty thongs doing splits on those matts, and then we're asked to get face down in child's pose on them?????). Most of the teachers are really bad and don't care to watch you succeed. They just like to prance around and do their own thing, but ignore you if you're having trouble. Two good teachers-- Claudia and Jordan. But it's disappointing they would work with such a bad company. ..The kicker is that BE SPUN robbed me of $100. They forced me to pay $100 to join their gym, telling me it would be a credit to use whenever I wanted,  but then never let me use that 100 towards anything. When I tried to use it they told me it 'expired', even though there was never initially an expiration date on it. They don't answer emails. These are all facts. I just want my money back at this point. The money they STOLE from me. Please be aware, buyer.

I used to follow her to another studio but then her schedule changed. I never knew about this place until she had told me. The good thing about this place is that it is nearer from where i lived and after checking about this place on their website, I saw that they offer more different classes on different levels. I like also that they have high pole which is harder to find in some locations and Wendy has been very nice and very patient in teaching me and the other students. I highly recommend going to this place and taking her class!",7ben0XwbjPlO7jtVWpwRvA,Mary Joyce C.,90046
