High intensity group fitness with an Aussie twist!,7825 Santa Monica Blvd,5.0,"Boot Camps,Interval Training,Gyms",Training Mate West Hollywood,168,3,,3/24/2019,"I checked out TM via class pass. Took Reuben's class a week ago, and recall there being a warm-up prior to starting stations. I took Ash's class yesterday, but there was no warm-up, which I found odd. Anyway, the only reason I went to TM is because I had to work in the morning and could not make it to my usual training spot on time. I will have to say, in comparison to other HIIT places, TM is not really challenging. If you're barely getting into HIIT you might like it, but for someone who's already done it for over a year it may be a bit of a bore. I honestly did not really break a sweat both times I went, and was not really challenged by the variety of weight options. ",mqMeo-UenRzZQLyXuH-PFQ,Ana S.,90046

He really got me exactly where I wanted to be so fast. I came in with no experience in anything.

I told Salar how I wanted my body to look and in a few months, and expectations were surpassed. My waist is the smallest it's ever been, I have abs!, and a booty! Most importantly, I feel good. I can run miles and not feel like I'm dying now. He taught me how to meal plan and prep. He was so attentive and really focused on my every move to make sure I didn't hurt myself. He was extremely patient with me. There would be days where I would tell him I hated him with almost every rep but he kept the workouts fun and kept me going with his encouragement.

"CFGH specializes in CrossFit, its methodologies, and its simplicity - which is why we are so effective. We also are highly effective at coaching other sports such as powerlifting, weightlifting and Strongman.

CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide. Also, moms, dads, students and other everyday athletes looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The CrossFit program is designed for universal scalability making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. We've used our same routines for elderly individuals with heart disease and cage fighters one month out from televised bouts. The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind, so we scale load and intensity based on the needs and capabilities of the individual athlete.

As a result, our program delivers a fitness that is, by design, broad, general, and inclusive. Our specialty is not specializing.

"CFGH specializes in CrossFit, its methodologies, and its simplicity - which is why we are so effective. We also are highly effective at coaching other sports such as powerlifting, weightlifting and Strongman.

CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide. Also, moms, dads, students and other everyday athletes looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The CrossFit program is designed for universal scalability making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. We've used our same routines for elderly individuals with heart disease and cage fighters one month out from televised bouts. The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind, so we scale load and intensity based on the needs and capabilities of the individual athlete.

I run, bike and take spin classes so I enjoy mixing up my workout and they don't offer class pass packages. It's $100 for the month which is very affordable if you're committed to coming every morning.

"After years of struggling with body image issues and an eating disorder I was determined to find an answer. I wanted to love my body and actually feel good in it. I didn't want to obsess over food, calories, weight, size.... I needed a solution, one that would stick. 

I've been on both sides of the spectrum, a fragile and alarming 86 pounds on a 5 '4 frame to a staggering and bone aching  170 . I restricted and deprived myself of joy and self love  and the other binged uncontrollably and indulged in access. Not being able to find a balance made me feel out of control.

I have always been relatively active but it always seemed like I either did yoga and had no definition or did HIIT/BBG workouts and had bulky legs. Kamila has been the first trainer to actually acknowledge that yes, you can bulk as a woman and tailor my workouts for lean definition. My sister even noticed a difference in my leg proportions after training with Mila and I couldn't be happier with my results. Workouts are fun with great music and there is a lot of stretching involved so you are rarely sore. I assumed I was rarely sore because I wasn't getting enough of a workout in only to go to yoga after a haitus and realize I was even stronger than when I had done intense HIIT training. She is also great at nutrition advice and finding what works for you vs pushing you into a set diet or plan.",1UqclYOoEcav54n0mkVr7w,Britanny C.,90291

The first 90 sec was the floor portion standing around trying to figure out what we're supposed to be doing. I took class with Ben which he was ok. I would give him 3 /5 stars. I would give his energy 2/5 stars. The room is insanely hot. They have 1 fan for the whole studio vs SF, that has at least three fans. All of their mirrors were completely fogged up and you could smell the sweat in the room. The front desk girl had to come open the back door. This should tell their studio they should do some improvements. I was wearing red pants and my pants were filthy from their weights. I put the weights down and had black all over my hands.

It's a great way to get strong with the correct form and mechanics and minimal room for error, which means less chance of injury.  This is definitely a great way to establish a good foundation and increase your strength. It's great for people of all ages, people who don't like to workout and those that do. What really attracted me was that I don't have much free time and needed something quick and effective.",c54DyTjIznRNxRjJjFog4w,Dawn Y.,90049

The instructors (Christy, Roland, and Laura) do a great job of explaining the very easy techniques and students are given ample time to practice them in full-force, full-contact situations. This is a co-ed class, the more intensive classes are gender-specific. Also, if you sign up for the workshop, the money you pay is applicable toward the tuition for the longer classes should you decide to continue on.

Whatever you do, take this class. I cannot recommend this class or company enough. I'm still talking and thinking about the class and we took it almost a month ago. Another reviewer said this class gives you a false sense of safety because now you think you can beat up anyone. I couldn't disagree more. In no world do I think I can get myself out of any situation, but suddenly, I have a lot more choices than I thought I did. This class made me realize how women (I know men have issues with men, but I'm a woman, so I'm coming at it from my perspective) are rarely rude to men we don't want contact from. We smile, we walk away (which is always preferable in a dangerous situation, so don't think they teach you to not get away), we sometimes don't listen to our gut instinct and intuition and that is was it actually dangerous. It is okay for my daughter to be rude (and get into the ready position) if some guy asks her for directions and then starts on about how beautiful she is, how old are you, all that crap we've all had to listen to all these years of being women. It teaches you how to USE YOUR VOICE! I hope I never have to use the skills they taught me, but at least I have them now. Also, I recommend reading the book, ""The Gift of Fear"" by Gavin DeBecker. Empower yourself, empower your daughters and sons. Even though only my daughter took the class with me, I came home and told my 10 year old about it and gave him some thoughts on if a stranger approaches him, etc. It opens up a dialogue with your children and that is so important! It was sobering when my daughter said to me, ""I've never once been rude to a guy who has tried to talk to me while walking, or at a store"" etc. And, that is crazy. She gets hit on all the time by adult men and she is 14. Take this class. Trust your instincts. Stop being polite (that's me talking). Talk with your children - male and female. Teach them what is appropriate and what is not right. I cannot tell you how much I loved this class.",FRAaSv1NMzxWXqjenEgIgg,Rachel Q.,90093

I have never been the petite dainty type despite growing up believing that's what I wanted. Instead I learned to embrace and love what I have and worked instead to define and sculpt my curves. At some point, I was having people ask me how they could tone their legs like mine! She made me strong physically and feel so mentally as well. I avoided the gym for years before her, never comfortable with it or myself until I decided to try training and found her and inner strength I never knew I had. She'll push you, probably with a smile on her face, and maybe a slightly evil laugh too, but she knows what she is doing. Seriously. She knows.

I've done a lot of workouts in NYC and LA. I like boxing, but I never feel like it really focuses on my muscles like pilates does, but then pilates doesn't burn the calories I need to eat ice cream every week. HIIT is nice but often gets boring to me (and I don't like to be yelled at!). Then I found MDR. First of all, just come in and see the girls and guys who are in these classes. They all have KILLER bodies. Long, lean with the line going down the bellies for the perfect abs. (How hard is it to carve that line?!) Second, the effects are almost immediate. I am telling you, if you start going here every other day, in two weeks, you'll see such a difference in your body it is unbelievable. Third, every workout is different, so it never gets boring. Plus, instructors have good playlists. Finally, finally, the people who work here make it the best! They are so understanding, remember your name, are funny as heck, and make the whole experience perfect. Thank you, MDR; I miss you already and it's only been a day! P.S.

I never feel like Rob is going to force an exercise that will aggravate my issues.  He has an elastic program that fits each individual he trains.  After the first 8 weeks of training I felt like I'd been physically upgraded.   I was stoked to continue working out!  I've had several people ask if I've lost weight and/or been sleeping better.  I know the workouts are helping me change. So I'll be continuing w Rob.  Stay tuned for updates!",0xKyDDeTl1HdxBPpIYhJ6Q,Jeremy C.,90046

His personal training program was customized to fit me. I'm happy to say that after working with Rob I dropped my weight 10 pounds, I lost 2 inches off my waist and my cholesterol was back to normal.

I began working with Rob and Devon having been totally skeptical that as a parent of two kids who works full time, I would be able to exercise and change my eating habits on a regular basis. I was completely convinced after 8 weeks, and continue to this day doing on this program. Rob is clear, warm and approachable, but also has high expectations for everyone he works with. He designed workouts that were varied, manageable, fun and challenging. Best of all, each workout was only 20 minutes each day, so there's just no excuse not to make time. Working with him changed my lifestyle in so many ways - from waking up early each day and working out, to being more mindful of what I eat, to helping my family make better health choices. Rob and Devon are also both realistic - they encourage and push (in the nicest ways) but also give you permission to take care of yourself, not feel the need to be perfect, and do the best you can in any given circumstance. They are both incredibly responsive and did everything to answer even the smallest question. I highly recommend Open Sky Fitness to everyone as a way to gain an understanding of what you need to live the healthiest life you can, no matter what your current situation.",4lfPrgkrbHc-JvkvZWPbGA,Sara L.,90046

I was not overweight but I was not building muscle and my joints were constantly inflamed and in pain. Rob not only taught me how to work out effectively, he taught me how to do it safely. He is the guy that the other trainers go to in the gym when they can't figure out what is wrong with their clients form and how to correct it - I'm not joking, this happened multiple times during our workouts. His way of working out is directed not only towards results, but also towards longevity. I can't stress how important that is or how wonderful it has been for me. He knows the body, how it works and what it needs to perform at it's best. He guides you in a way that makes sense and makes you feel in control of yourself and your body.

It's hard to find a gym where women can feel comfortable enough to use all the equipment that's provided or even ask for help if needed. They also have women group sessions! So if you feel a little bit intimidated to do a one on one class you can do a group class. Also, Byanka will help you with meal plans, supplements and more.

Then one night I see a woman locking up and leaving. My curiosity was sparked. I'm a bit shy and a bit intimidated by male dominated places but I thought maybe I'll call and see if they've got female trainers. So I took the first step to try something new,  called and yes! There is a female trainer, she was put on the phone and I started asking questions. What kind of classes should I try if I have zero on top of zero experience (unless you count tae-bo from the 90s)? She recommends a couple difference classes meant for beginners and possibly with her teaching so I may feel less intimidated being the only female. She gives a couple different days and times, st which I take note and say 'ok, thank you for your help! Maybe I'll try the Tuesday morning class sometime"".

Classes for beginners and advanced",1234 North La Brea Ave,5.0,"Muay Thai,Brazilian Jiu,jitsu,Kickboxing",KINGS MMA - West Hollywood,22,5,,8/2/2017,"So my personal trainer recommended that I do some martial arts to recover my balance and strength from my old ice hockey injuries and improve my cardio. He noticed that Kings MMA was up the street and he insisted I check it out. I am used to seeing sparring since my younger brother is a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I had some exposure to martial arts earlier in my life. However, I have no experience with either Muay Thai or Jiu Jitsu. I was super excited to try them out! Now, I am a girl, and generally expect to see in contact sports more guys than girls (which isn't an issue for me) but I was happy to see some fellow ladies in class woo hoo! In Muay Thai, Coach Vinnie and Coach Steve are very patient with me being such a clumsy noob and even laugh because well I think it's hilarious to hop around and kick and punch. What can I say it's entertaining. There are varying degrees of experienced students in class which helps someone like me learn as I can get correction as needed. I have also been starting Jiu Jitsu and Leandro was very helpful. He got in right away to help the students learn how to pose in a fight and started teaching maneuvers the first day which were challenging but fun. We got to spar as well and I could not stop laughing. I literally have a blast! The cost of the classes is extremely reasonable for the amount of days a week you can go as well as the times available. I would recommend going during morning sessions if you are a super noob like me because there are less students and you will get more attention. If you are looking to continue your education then you are probably safe to do a later class. Either way I highly recommend Kings MMA!!!",xussYYBykfHhpIdSBsGI_Q,Maureen J.,90038

I joined Sandbox 3 years ago, right around the time they first opened up. From the start, I felt very comfortable and not intimidated by the classes or workouts. All of the instructors are very encouraging, kind, and since class sizes are smaller, I got more individual attention/corrections on my technique. Also, not to mention you get the workout in the sand and feel like you are at the beach. Its a prime location because although thw beach is not too far away from the SF Valley, LA traffic is insane and this gym helps you get a full-body beach/sand workout without the long drive! Not only that, but you have amazing and kind instructors to help you meet your personal body goals. You also burn more calories working out in the sand, so sometimes I would still see results and improvements days after one class! Its awesome! My favorite instructors are Jessica, Tonni, and Minna. They each bring something completely different to each class, but its great because it keeps workouts new and challenging!",m05mf7h7VWIDGec1uwh1Tg,Sydni P.,91423

I was at the point where I just accepted that these injuries would just be a fact of ""life after 40"". I've done intense bootcamps in the past and love the camaraderie associated with this type of tough workout but Guy takes it to a whole new level. His extensive knowledge in all areas of health, from fitness and nutrition to good postural alignment are extremely impressive. He takes the time to address any poor form he sees during the workout (instead of letting you ""power through"" pathetic push-ups or bad burpees like many bootcamp trainers will let you do!) He shows the importance of good form so that you DON'T get injuries or limitations (or worsen the ones you already have). I now see how ""unaligned"" I was and am so happy with my new injury-free me!!

I lost inches around my waist, arms and thighs and went down a pants size.  My ultimate goal was to lose 15-20 pounds, and I am well on my way there. It was great to work out in a program where the trainer actually knew my name, and could push me when I wouldn't usually push myself. Additionally, I went to his 6am class 3 days a week, initially I was less than enthused to wake up at 5:30am to work out, but turns out I like it so much better. Thanks to Bootcamp, I am now working out consistently in the morning. Not only did bootcamp help me lose weight, but it also helped me create healthy eating and exercise habbits.

The teachers are the most lovely people and it is such a great workout. I've been to studios around the world but this is by far my favourite. There is a great feeling when you walk in and you feel great when you walk out. It's the kind of place that makes you WANT to get out of bed to go to. I really cannot express quite how wonderful this studio is- and it's the fastest (and safest) way to get toned and lean in a short amount of time.

I've always been an inconsistent yogi/hiker/dancer when it comes to fitness, and I took a mat Pilates class many years ago that scared me off for a long time. I do not respond well to super-intense, boot-camp-style stuff. But this year I decided it was really time to add strengthening into my routine, and I heard the reformer was the way to go. So, after reading all the great reviews on here, I decided to try a private session at Wunda. I figured at least I'd only be embarrassed/miserable in front of one person. But I was neither of those things! Anna was welcoming, supportive, informative, and fun. She gave me the confidence to try the group classes next. Highly recommend an initial private session to get the lay of the land, and definitely recommend Anna as an instructor!",go7G0Xh5mXXoJNJO-ggkcg,Lyssa D.,90027

For the first year or so, I only went once or twice a week, but as I started to progress and get better, I decided it was time to take the plunge and purchase an unlimited membership. It was so worth it! Now, I go religiously to the 7am classes 5 days a week. The more frequently you're able to go to class, the better your results will be, but even when I was just going twice a week I could feel myself getting stronger. You don't have to be a pro or have any previous Pilates experience; the instructors will meet you where you're at and work with you to help you progress over time. Just be sure to let them know if you have any injuries or what your level of experience is. When I first started, I could hardly hold a plank on the reformer without taking a break every couple of seconds, but now I can complete an entire planking series with ease. The instructors here are great (although I really miss Nancy's 7am classes!) Ricardo always manages to kick my butt and make my laugh during class. Stephanie (the owner) was the first instructor I ever had there, and she has been a great motivator for me over the years. Bisi likes to try all sorts of new things in her classes, and she always has the perfect music-- lots of late 90s/early 2000s hip-hop and R&B (and some of my fav Destiny's Child tracks). Ashley is a great motivator and keeps things fun, even when you're sweating a ton. I use the Club Pilates app to book all of my classes, which is super easy to use and guarantees that I always get into the classes I want. They also have fun challenges and events throughout the year, like the Friends Fit Challenge. I've made several friends there over the years, and it's definitely a great community to be a part of.

You can measure your results, your calories burned, and the number of minutes that you have spent in cardiovascular zones 4 and 5 as you work out so that you understand your results down to the detailed math and you don't walk away with a false sense of achievement just because you're sweaty (I'm talking to YOU, hot yoga). Plus, the trainers are just nice affable super respectful guys. As a female, I really appreciated their vibe AND their expertise. -Miriam",zGYOmv5hKUjQdZI8JLh9Jw,FoodieChic K.,90048

From day one, he helped not only with perfecting simple form and techniques during our workouts but also with the nutritional aspects that I have always had such a hard time with. In the workouts, there was a perfect balance of training with my own body weight, weightlifting and the use of machines in the gym. His advice, his critiques, his motivation and his knowledge really pushed me in such a positive way. The day before I first trained with him for a full session, I was at 167 lbs. Three months later and I am at 142 lbs! Losing these first 25 lbs seemed absolutely impossible on my own. I was very unmotivated but knew I needed a kick in the butt, so to speak, and I needed to start working with someone who would guide me in the right direction. Bayo is definitely that kind of trainer.  My photo for proof shows me wearing a pair of pants I purchased a week before I started training. They were VERY  fitted throughout when I bought them!

I go here almost everyday to get in a full-body workout. Before M/Body I used to do HIIT classes that resulted in me hurting myself (shin splints, plantar fasciitis, knee injuries and more) while engaging in unhealthy competition instead of enjoying the workout and having fun. I realized that if I can't do an exercise when I'm 90, I probably shouldn't be doing it now. Here, people come of all ages from 14 to 70 (or even older!) M/BODY is an intense workout that can be modified for your specific needs. You're encouraged to modify any exercise that doesn't feel right for your body. That's the best thing about this place: you get to be part of a beautiful community of mostly women who are amazing and lift each other up and you get to be YOU. That spirit trickles down from Marnie who pushes us to our limits all while smiling and being happy. It has shifted how I view my workout from dread and competition to happiness and joy. Every word out of Marnie's mouth is something that has made me into a better human. That's where the spiritual growth comes in. Her class will change your life and push you past your limits while empowering you and lifting up your self-esteem. ALL the instructors here are amazingly talented: Kate, Kayla, Lauren and Kiara all push you and support you in their own unique ways with their own unique music and personalities. They are invested in the clients and their well-being during and after class. No matter how you feel before class, you'll leave feeling good about yourself and in just a few weeks your body will start changing and your legs and bottom will never have looked better! What's extra special about this place is that it's a TRUE community of beautiful people that have become my FRIENDS and FAMILY and can be yours too.

The good kind of sore, the kind of sore where you know you will get results if you keep at it.

My clothes feel looser, I can do more difficult exercises with more confidence and strength. I have a couple of pains doing certain moves and Britta either does adjustments or comes back to them later when I've gotten stronger. Super convenient location across from the Paramount Studios lot and has a second location on Larchmont. She's flexible, understanding, and more importantly a cheerleader. She pushes me when I want to quit and always makes sure I'm feeling good and not in pain. Highly recommend Britta.

Strength Rx helped kicked my body into high gear! As an older women who is a former athlete of well over 2 decades ago, I felt it was nearly impossible to get my body and health back. I was wrong- the coaches at Strength RX, kicked my butt and literally in 8 weeks, this happened! I started on a "" Free Trial"" but that came with a fee- you don't meet body fat- you loose money but it went towards membership...I felt this was worth it. You get comprehensive meal plans and if you are new to fitness, I strongly encourage following them. ( you can use so many spices, peppers etc to flare up your meals) This gym is a 40 min commute for me- I still try to make it work, because it is that good! The coaches are great, you eventually get to know each one and what their stye of teaching is. I stopped going for 5 months because of 1 month of travel and work issues but just got back on. Let me tell you, no matter your fitness level- YOU CAN DO THIS! There is every body shape and size, don't worry! You start with ""Burn Classes"" everyone in this class is beginners with little to no knowledge or someone that has been doing it and can high five you to get you pumped- So do not be intimated! If you can't do a particular exercise, speak up! Coaches are more than happy to help modify for you or, if are like me and have old sports injuries- IT IS OK! They are not going to make you max out and make you feel bad. This becomes a community, we all help each-other.I just came back after 5 months on a truly free trial to give feedback and I will keep you posted! They genuinely seemed to care what members feel.

Anyway, walking into the place for the first time I honestly was impressed by their state of the art equipment and screens that guide you through each workout station. Unlike other HIIT places where the trainers give you the run through of the workout once, and will only walk around sparingly, the F45 team make sure to check for form and make any adjustments to prevent injury. In addition, they will challenge you if they notice you're a beast :), which I greatly appreciate. The coaches are extremely welcoming, I have taken classes with Gaby, Will, Chelsea, Greg, Michael and Peter. ",mqMeo-UenRzZQLyXuH-PFQ,Ana S.,90038

He works with your schedule and on Saturday's he has a bootcamp on top of the Baldwin Hills scenic overlook. It's killer! But once you're done you'll feel accomplished.

This is the perfect box to start at... And continue long-term. There are so many things here that have kept me coming consistently since the day I started. First and foremost, it is the sense of community. Everyone is so welcoming, the coaches and other members, and you never feel out of place. This box caps their classes at 12 people (lift only classes are capped at 6 or 7) which allows for the coaches to see everyone, and adjust/correct your form, which is so valuable in Crossfit. Everyone, including myself, is afraid that I will get injured but I have no doubt I am in good hands with the supervision and expertise of all of the coaches. They also organize a social calendar that keeps all of the members engaged and feeling like a family. Most members have been here for 2+ years. They keep their place clean, have two bathrooms, and a really nice shower (bring your own towel). I've never felt so confident at a new gym and new extremely unfamiliar workouts. Every single class is different, you are always being challenged and learning something new, and you are always having fun with it, even if it's painful. I have totally been sucked in to this community and I love every second of it! Join this box if you are considering Crossfit, I promise it's worth it.",TkYMJnYuVUZ-SsEYVZCCRg,Tiffany R.,90036

I would love to rate this place 5 stars, but unfortunately they pulled a serious dick move. When I injured my ankle recently, they refused to put my membership on pause.  When you sign up, they tell you that you can pause your membership at any time for $50. This is a lie. They offered to pause my membership on March 1st (I made the request at the beginning of February) basically telling me I had no choice but to wave goodbye to the money I had already paid for the month of February. It's bad enough that they charge you $50 to pause a membership, but they then restrict your ability to pause it to only one day per month, and then they lie to you about it when you sign up.

Sure it's intimidating to start something new, and with all of the barbells being thrown around, and lots of terminology, and people who look AMAZING and perform even better....it can feel isolating (like one review said), but that's just called starting something new! I was probably one of the most scared to ever be a beginner, this was my first box, and everyone there was so supportive. I humbly and appreciatively call them all friends now! I've had to attend a few other boxes with a job that has taken me outside of Hollywood and little did I know how much I had lucked put having CFHW as my newbie box! After having experienced a few other boxes, I've realized a few things unique to this place. The programming is OUTSTANDING. Fun and results driven which is a hard line to follow. The energy of the members, in my humble opinion, is unmatched and so, SO motivating. The coaches. Enough said. They rock. All of them. So technically sound and personally invested. I love this place. Can't WAIT until a show puts me back in Hollywood so I can come back!  And a minor point, the dues are competitive with boxes of the similar caliber and location. It's crossfit.

The people here are great. The prices are super reasonable. I came to a couple Saturday morning classes and everyone is so supportive. I was a little nervous because the first time I went, I came alone. I have absolutely no experience so I was scared I was going to look like an idiot. Everyone made me feel so at home. There are a few exercises you go through where you partner up with people and everyone I was paired with was super friendly and willing to help me if I had questions about the form. People range in skill level as well so I didn't feel too far behind. The family that runs the classes is so sweet and upbeat. They're happy to pop by and help you out. I brought a few of my friends one time that had absolutely no interest in boxing and all of them had a really fun time. Two of them continued coming back each Saturday. My only gripe was that the Saturday morning class is insanely crowded, but that's just normal LA. You will be dripping in sweat by the end of the hour. Since my classes, I joined a gym that offered free boxing classes with my membership, so I felt bad spending money outside of that, but idk . . . recently I've been wanting to go back.",iDhkqbfV9du4DY5mQsdh2A,Rachel K.,91403

I went to one class and was underwhelmed bc they have beginners and intermediates mixed in. First class was one instructor teaching students on multiple apparatuses. Which is frustrating if you're just there to learn silks you have to wait your turn and watch the instructor teach other students on apparatuses you don't care to learn which a waste of time to me. Second class were 9 students beginners and intermediates as well as adults and teens. My suggestion would be separate the beginners and intermediates or the teens and adults, all the teens were bored and incredibly distracting when the instructor was teaching trapeze and hammock and since the class was so big we didn't even get to the silks. I felt very frustrated having wasted $30 not learning anything I wanted to learn and instead felt like I was in some after school program watching kids learn and run around the trapeze. Needless to say I won't be coming back here. If you're new and learning I recommend going somewhere else. I hear Womack and Bowman have great classes but haven't been to one yet.",j7ol3870TGcNwGUKGVR5Pg,Sarai S.,90041

The staff could not be more friendly or welcoming, which was such a breath of fresh air! Especially in LA! The front desk girl gave me a tour and showed me exactly what I needed to do. The instructor was incredible, high energy with probably best music I have experienced in a class. After class I got the ""GBJ"" smoothie from the Health House cafe. It may be a stretch, but this is also one of the best smoothies I have had! They also have bars and grab and go bites and a mix of smoothies to choose from.

While Kickboxing may sound intimidating, I promise you get what you put into it...Yes, just like everything else in life. Kickboxing is one of the best cardio around, and it's a full body workout. I've notice how much stronger my punches and kicks have gotten since I started taking classes with Sheila. The classes are challenging, but that's exactly why I go. Other group based cardio classes can be a workout, but it doesn't teach anything about basic self-defense. I love the fact that fact that I'm sweating from start to finish. The 10 minutes before and after making use of your boxing gloves are my favorite. Those exercises focus on different muscles every day, but they leave me feeling the burn the next day.

Both Sue and Patricia are excellent teachers with radiant healthy energy. My hips have become liberated and limber from the workouts. I have a defined center of balance and hold myself with dignity because of the work out. I relish the 'zen frog' pose which provides me with defined safe space both physically and mentally. Summoning zen frog in crowded situations has calmed and centered me. I like it that the classes are not crowded. The practice has helped me with emotional stress when I had no one to share what I was going through. It is also fun because I don't sweat and the water supports my the weight of my body which is definitely more limber and stronger as a result. H2Yoga has been a real blessing and has improved the quality of my life. Thank you.,KsP4rk3u2HfV6UlhLsn5_Q,Jane E.,90036

She hadn't tried the challenge but we were both very curious and pumped up about getting fit and getting advice so that we could work out better and learn about fitness. The link did not provide many details so we signed up and attended one of the night orientation dates. The address was easy to find however there was no sign outside saying ""LA transformation academy or fit and fun fitness transformation academy, or whatever it is called. Once inside the gym looked pretty nice, just one huge room on the 2nd floor with superheroes printed on the walls. We liked the vibe, and the workout music but once we heard the details we were disappointed to hear about the $497 deposit that is not guaranteed you will get back. There is criteria to be met including going 42 days without alcohol, checking in on Facebook 5x a week, and you must lose 20lbs in order for your deposit to be refunded. Some people just walked out while others filled the paperwork ( you MUST give your bank card info and have paid the $497 before the 1st day of the challenge). We told Irma we did not have the $497, we believed it was a TRULY FREE program but of course there is always a catch. She did not seem so nice when she knew we could not deposit that much and instead said ""oh maybe you can sign up for the challenge a month ahead instead just fill in the paperwork and we won't charge your card until then it'll save you a trip"". Of course now I knew what people meant about her being money hungry. The right thing to have done is for her to talk to us on the side and perhaps discuss our financial situation or what else we could do. This program is biased and unfair to those who are really committed, willing to learn and get pushed in the right direction , but do NOT have $500 to be throwing at Irma's bank account. Wish she would've stated that before and saved us from the trip, time, effort and excitement for nothing. She is bad at replying and getting back to you on Facebook. The fact that she hides requiring the $497 deposit makes me feel like there is something weird going on, fraud, or another catch we are not aware of.",ZAn6gJRMwjpRqmH3Ilz9Ww,Heidi R.,90034

My fiancé and I were having trouble coming to an agreement on what our song should be; so during our first lesson, we presented Kristina with our four final selections and began narrowing it down by the types of dance associated with each song, along with our comfort level. We were able to quickly narrow it down to our final choice within a mere ten minutes. She made it so easy! Kristina was incredibly patient despite us repeatedly making the same mistakes throughout each lesson. She never expressed any negative judgment or frustration when we didn't put her suggestions into practice. We're truly creatures of habit who have a hard time breaking away from bad habits. She would tailor her explanation each time so that it would be easily understandable. Her calm disposition often helped relieve a lot of the stress and pressure associated with dancing (for those of us who are incredibly unseasoned.)Nonetheless, when we rewatch our videos (we had recorded each lesson on our respective phones), we see the tremendous improvement thanks to Kristina's guidance. We were honestly the most self-conscious, unconfident dancers and now we're actually looking forward to our performance.

He saw me struggling in the gym and came over one day and we started talking about lifting. I explained to him that I am mainly into boxing but that I needed to become stronger to really hold my own while sparring. The next week we began working together and it has been fantastic ever since. Russ made my form the most important aspect of my training initially and because of this, I am super confident in my ability to squat, bench, deadlift and overhead press without killing myself. He has me on a very simple, but very effective strength program which has helped increased all four of the main lifts. It is also important to explain that he was able to develop a strength training program that didn't interfere with the boxing training I had going on simultaneously. Most of the time, training a sport that has a serious cardiovascular and endurance component to it all while training for strength is problematic. However, in this case, it's worked out extremely well. On top of all of this, Russ is a great guy. No nonsense, no B.S. I like to train when I'm in the gym, not talk and socialize and when we happen to be at the gym together, he totally respects that. So many trainers take up you're training time talking about themselves and about what they are doing as if they are on a sitcom or doing a standup routine. Not here.

"Flight School is barre 2.0. A fresh more effective update to the old barre routine. See the video at our website. Scientific evidence indicates that the ballerina body is not created simply by plies. The ballet body is actually developed by ballet jumping which forces the body to create the long lean muscle called type 2 fast twitch fiber. Type 2 is what gives a ballerina a lean but rock solid appearance and it is only created through explosive mevement. At ALIGN we don't care what you look like but if you want specific results you need a very specific fitness program and Flight School delivers the ballet body secret sauce. Any program without athletic ballet jumping in not going to have the desired results, it is simply not possible. Plus it is FUN! Yet jumping is optional and this program is for anyone at any fitness level. ALIGN founder Michael Cornell has designed a program that is easily modified for all levels of fitness. You may do this workout no, low, or high impact, it's your choice! We primarily teach straight up ballet classes but Flight School is used by many of our students to increase their strength and endurance. Cardio, strength, core, balance, flexibility, and endurance Flight School provided it all in a simple 1 hour no prior experience necessary body blast. Come try it out. Use promo code ""flynow"" for a free single class credit.",6085 W Pico,5.0,"Barre Classes,Cardio Classes,Dance Studios",Flight School,4,5,Carthay,3/9/2018,"I really enjoy Flight School because it's easy to follow along, gives me a great cardio workout, uses body weight-resistance training for strength, adds some abs, and Michael plays great music! It's a fun workout but a good one, too. Michael has extensive experience in both fitness and dance, so the class design is flexibly rigorous. You can go at your own pace and ramp it up or down. Zoe is a great instructor as well, I know her from Align Ballet. So there are 3 evening options in Downtown LA that I would recommend. That location is close to the Pico station on the blue line. I transfer from the red line and avoid all traffic and parking issues. With daylight savings around the corner, no excuse not to use public transit! Michael also teaches in other locations. I'm hoping to work up to 2 per week.",ii2exaQ8kJfMzdO31SNfVA,Catherine S.,90035

I am currently enrolled in the studio's series class, which allows you to dance with the same group of students each month. I feel like this builds such a strong community within the studio, because you really get to know the other students and can form great connections. You never feel alone in a class! The flo classes are great too because you get to try out different styles of pole dancing.

Dr. Sheila and her staff are truly amazing! They helped me design a weight loss program fit just to me, and the weekly check-ins not only motivated me but kept me accountable. I've always wanted to feel great in my own skin and after only a few short weeks into this program my life and waist size is changing before my eyes! I could not thank Dr. Sheila and her staff enough. Being a new mom of a 10 month old and always struggling with weight loss I felt like I would never get to my goal weight. But here I am now proud and ready to take on the rest of my journey knowing that Dr. Sheila and her team are with me every step of the way. I started only 4 weeks ago at 196.9 pounds up 40 pounds from my goal weight. As of now I've lost 14lbs in 4 weeks. This is not a diet, it's a life change. Dr. Sheila customized a plan just for me and it's great because your eating real food, no shakes, no starving yourself, real food! The metobolic boosters are amazing, it gives me additional energy and helps me take on the world! The office is so clean and inviting! I can't say enough wonderful things about this program and the people who support it. The most important thing I wanted was someone who understood my daily struggle and could relate to my weight loss journey. Dr. Sheila designed this program based upon her own weight loss journey many years ago! To her and her staff I am so internally grateful and please if your reading this know that it could change your life too! Please go today even if it's just to ask questions or see if it's a right fit for you! I promise you it won't disappoint! Best journey I've been on yet!",nMAzZ6U_6giA33djhO6BEQ,Heather G.,90025

It took a while to find the right workout for me. Seriously, I am not a big fan of any kind of workout. But teachers here, especially Sean and Viviana have been great for me to strengthen my core and fix my bad posture like forward head posture including my neck and shoulder pain. Their 1 to 1 lesson starts with cardio exercise that gives a pleasant sweat and follows with customized pilates posture using reformer. This 50 minutes program is pretty intense, so you will walk away with lots of sweat feeling so energized in a way although your legs will be a bit shaky. The studio is very clean and teachers are super friendly. You can either do the single or duo. I do both, one with more intense, one with my friend that makes the session more fun. I tried group lessons first, but I was injured and hard to follow. I strongly recommend private lesson for Pilates, and you will know why at this studio and feel totally worth it!!

I've been taking a private class and duet class sometimes for a year. Before I started pilates, my body was in sore of back, neck, and shoulder pain, and I was a huge fan of acupuncture and chiropractic. I believed that medicine and treatment could help my body relaxed and fixed, but it was still same in pain. I've heard from one of my friends that pilates is really helpful for the balance and fix of body, so I've tried it. At the first time, I could not satisfy with exercising, and felt 'why am I doing it now with expensive class fee?', but every concern has been solved after 3 months from starting pilates. Now, I have a straightened body and a tight core belly and back. Also, neck and shoulder are so relaxed and smoothed. If you have any kind of pain as me, I absolutely recommend pilates for 2 months at least.

I literally moved from Las Vegas to train with him at Mansion Fitness. No regrets! In my youth I was an athlete, so I expected Mansion Fitness to be like every other gym to which I have belonged. However, when I walked into Mansion Fitness my first thought was, ""Holy Smokes!"" The equipment is top notch, the wallpaper is the Haunted Mansion level of cool, and you can't beat the chandeliers. The seating area has super comfy wingback chairs in which I quite enjoy sitting before my sessions with Rodiney. During my sessions, I must say that the music selection is upbeat and fun. Many times while resting between weight circuits, Rodiney and I have danced around like a couple of chipmunks. The environment is conducive to such frivolity. Since clients here work with personal trainers it's not crowded or distracting and even when we need to wait for a machine because it's popular that day, there are plenty of more types to choose from which satisfy another part of my training. The machines are well-maintained and clean. The shower room is well-stocked and clean as are the bathrooms. The lockers are convenient and are located on both the top and bottom floors. The fact is, I come 3 hours one way on a bus and train to get to Mansion Fitness and so I bring a stuffed backpack of necessities; it easily fits in the lockers so that is a huge plus! Lastly, I have to say I walked in thinking that such a classy establishment would harbor elitist staff. I found this to not be the case. The front desk staff are quite friendly and cheery and I've chatted with a few in house trainers while waiting for Rodiney to finish with an early client and have found them to be equally friendly and easygoing. Overall my experience at Mansion Fitness has been very positive and I recommend them to anyone who wants to enjoy their time at the gym as I have thus far.",xussYYBykfHhpIdSBsGI_Q,Maureen J.,90069

It's not gimmicky or superficial. It is real fitness. I am a personal trainer in Los Angeles and I'm very picky about where I workout. There are not many group classes that check all of the boxes but Real Fitness does! Each workout has a full and proper warm up, designed specifically to prep your body for the workout that day. The workouts are a mixture of functional strength and purposeful conditioning. There is enough variety so that you never get bored, but enough consistency where you can see progress. Each workout has a perfect work to rest ratio, just enough rest so that you can recover between sets and give it your all at each station. These full body workouts are thoughtfully planned and hit all of the fundamental movements patterns in a balanced way - hinge, squat, push, pull, rotation, & anti-rotation. You get to work on power, strength, speed and stability. The workouts are challenging just as they are programmed but you can modify depending on your ability or how you are feeling that day. They help you modify to make it easier for beginners or on days when you're just not feeling your best AND they challenge you to take it up a notch for the more advanced athletes or on days that you are at your peak. There is always a cool down & stretching at the end of each class. You will always leave the workout feeling good. All of the coaches and clients that I've met are super nice and you can tell the culture is just a good group of genuine people. The coaches provide individual form corrections, as well as personalized encouragement & positive feedback. Train here if you want to get fit, have fun & feel good.",NOvnusjd7ZuLsKlEx1mN6Q,Amy P.,90293

I honestly love this friendly neighborhood gym and its culture. There are NO judgements at this place. All the trainers are supportive as they work with you. When I first started, I had no balance and strength whatsoever. I was intimidated by the group classes cause everyone looked like they knew what they were doing and couldn't understand any of the movements written on the board and verbally explained. Lucho and Peter have been so patient in working with me during small group classes. The more I came to class consistently, I've gained confidence in doing the exercises ""finessely."" Now, if I don't work out at least 4 times a week, I feel like a part of me is missing haha. I challenged myself to take the group classes that I thought were scary with Michael and Jesse; it's been a piece of cake hahaha. Classes (strength, boxing, barbell, and circuit burn) NEVER get boring, and all the classes get you sweating! They're always fun and challenging. They bump really good music while you workout and sometimse all you want to do is dance or go HAM cause it motivates you to keep going. Also, the members are friendly and pump you up during workouts.

For every exercise the instructor teaches you a modification if it's too hard, but if they see that it's too easy they also encourage you to try the harder variation.

"We offer instruction in the Afro-Brazilian martial art Capoeira.  Classes are open to all levels.  Students of all ages will gain skills in self defense, fitness and acrobatics.
 Our teacher Professor Pezão is a graduated Professor under Mestre Amen, founder of the longest running Capoeira school in Southern California Capoeira Batuque.

Mixed level Capoeira classes: 
Monday, Thursday 6:30-8:00",1746 W Adams Blvd,5.0,Martial Arts,Capoeira Batuque,6,5,Adams Normandie,4/23/2016,"For anyone new to capoeira: capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art that contains elements of self-expression, music, and dance. It is a fantastic workout that combines cardio and whole-body strength training through a combination of kicks, escapes, and acrobatic-like movements (modified cartwheels, handstands). All of this is done to music, keeping the energy high. Typically, you train for the first part of class (practice movements), and then ""play capoeira"" for the last part (engage back and forth with a partner in kicks and escapes).",G-v1HMu9vN2VvHGZYHYbyA,Michelle P.,90018

I couldn't be more happy. And prof. Pezao is the reason why. I could go into all of his knowledge of the history, movement and music and name all the names of who's he's trained under, but I feel the need to talk about the person he is because you can love any sport or activity you do, but what makes it so much more than just a great workout is the person you are training under. This man is such a positive light, always encouraging us and pushing us, believing in us.  Being 41, some of the movements are a little more difficult for me and I don't always understand. But Pezao is always so supportive, showing me other options that make it work and patiently answers my millions of questions. He's also helped me do movements I never thought possible, or ever had the courage to do. So don't be afraid to try a class if you are big, small, young or old, he works with you and your strengths and weaknesses. Don't get me wrong though, he works us pretty good. I'm usually soaking wet after a night of training and often times sore. Yet I happily return for more. There are many great capoeira teachers who are skilled in their craft, Pezao is definitely one of them, but he is a man of good character, someone who I respect, who also respects me. As a woman, that means a lot. He treats me as an equal. He's not a creep.  (I'm sure women will understand what I'm saying haha.) he cares about his students as human beings, often times calling or texting to see how things are, just because. I could go on forever....if you want a great challenging workout and some good vibes, come to prof. Pezaos class. You won't regret it!",pUUYUFbTDv-f41qiKOFNpg,Pinky T.,90018

To get into a higher level class, you need experience in both trapeze and silks; meaning if you only have experience in silks, but not on trapeze, they will not let you into the higher level aerial classes.  Based on this, I can sympathize with individuals that have been training in lyra or hammock for a while, but now are being demoted into the intro class where they feel unchallenged on these apparatuses.

If you're looking for a fun and supportive environment to start achieving your fitness goals - look no further. I did the 6 week challenge with Ted and finally lost those pesky last 10 lbs from my first pregnancy (gulp-3 years ago). The diet during those 6 weeks is hard, but it's not meant to last forever, just think of it as a jumpstart towards a healthier lifestyle and exercise routine. The classes are 40 minutes with abs and stretching afterwards if you choose. I find that 3xs a week is all I need to stay fit and healthy (especially when eating healthy). And the classes are FUN and HARD. You are basically just competing with yourself which is awesome and everyone is at a different place fitness-wise, so I don't think anyone feels out of place. The trainers, Gina and Scott are so nice, knowledgeable and helpful. I'm only here for a year and I'm already sad I'll have to leave this place in July.

The next day I felt like I had worked muscles that hadn't been accessed in years (and I am a zumba, running, hiking addict).

After I moved to LA recently, my doctor recommended for this exotic exercise to relieve my shoulder and back pain. At first trying out pilates was rather intimidating with all the special equipment that looked to me more like torture devices. But Regina made it so easy and comfortable with her clear instructions and kind attitude so I finished my first lesson feeling rewarded and my bones and muscle reassembled. Only after one class, my wife was surprised to see my posture improved dramatically as I could walk with my back straight! The chronic pain I suffered is almost gone now that I can sleep better. I like her teaching style that is very professional, precise and patient, so it's easy to follow at my own pace. Regina is much more than a pilates instructor. I can tell in every class she genuinely cares about my health and well-being so she gives full attention to what I am going though both physically and emotionally. I would recommend Regina's class to especially people like me in their 60-70s who have not been physically active but want to try something new to stop getting too old before it's too late.

A year later and I've PRed my half time, have a community of amazing friends and can do things I never thought I could do.

Her new gym at RUT is well-stocked -- it includes dumbbells, plates, kettle bells, sandbags, wreck bags, medicine balls, punching bags, and even a run of monkeybars. And it's close enough to the ocean that some days a class will go out and work out in the sand or on the rings at Santa Monica beach.",3GB7j_zwbdh-3al84ba3mg,Drew T.,90405

I went in to the studio for my class a bit early to see other members stretching/ warming up which was a bit intimidating as I had no idea what to do. Class quickly started, and Karen was wonderful right out the gate. She has such a soothing voice, her music was PERFECT, and she was a great guide through the class. I never once felt lost or confused. Karen did a fantastic job of demonstrating every move while giving a thorough explanation.

The guy picks up and says in a very sarcastic tone ""yea I answered your question, are we good here bro?"" as I was about to tell him how rude his customer service is, he then hung up on me again.

Thanks, DC Fitness Staff",626 Coronado Ter,4.5,"Gyms,Trainers",DC Fitness,20,5,Echo Park,6/17/2019,I won't lie when I found out this gym was part of a church I was worried because i am far from religious but I have to say you wouldn't even know it was affiliated with a church if you didn't look it up. Everyone is super nice and the gym is great. The best bang for your buck no question. I saw someone said they only had one shower in the men's locker room but there are three now so keep in mind a lot of stuff has been updated since the older posts. And I concur with the other people who say this is a no frills gym but it's not a no frills gym in the sense that everyone in there is super intense and in crazy good shape (which is what I interpreted by the saying). If anything this is the gym where being a beginner you actually feel like no one is judging you because no one is. Can't say enough good things about this place.,ItY-l2_9_RDNPu4vo7CW8w,Nicolas T.,90026

According to their site they're expanding their hours too, a major bonus... as of right now they close early on Thursdays and aren't open at all on Sundays, but seems like this will change in 2019.

Thanks, DC Fitness Staff",626 Coronado Ter,4.5,"Gyms,Trainers",DC Fitness,20,5,Echo Park,11/17/2016,"A community gem. I've recently moved back into the area and have been looking for a good gym to join. Glad I stopped by DC Fitness before checking out the gyms in DTLA (LA Fitness, PF, 24 Hour, etc) as it has turned out to be perfect for my needs, with none of the downsides of a typical gym. I'm mainly at the gym to lift so I was looking for a squat rack and bench. Was very surprised to find both of those as well as deadlift stations in a community gym such as this! If you're looking to do cardio, they've got a dedicated cardio room and a small grass area for plyos, with a couple basketball courts upstairs. Staff members could not be friendlier (shout out to Mike) and are available for any questions you've got on specific exercises or for personal training (I believe they are all certified). The price is great. DC Fitness maintains community access to its facilities with a low membership cost of $25 a month with a one-time $15 initiation fee. Month-to-month, no forced year-long contracts like other gyms. While the price is reflected in its selection of older machines and equipment, they are all still serviceable and have done just fine for my workouts. Lots of free weights available, yoga mats, foam rollers, jump ropes, two punching bags, medicine balls, and more. The gym is clean and has had cleaning solution and paper towels stocked every time I've gone. There's one restroom and one shower for men, with the shower area first sectioned off with a large shower curtain (no door, so pull it over to indicate you're occupying the space), and the shower itself behind another curtain. Bring your own towel, soap, and sandals.",PQEjUFvFogNw3WpJo24ACg,Wayne W.,90026

I've gone to maybe 20 different gyms, classes, and various fitness studios throughout the past ten years. Some were ok, some I've liked, but this one I LOVE! The space is very bright and clean. The culture and workouts are very female friendly and they have a good, maybe 60/40 or even 50/50 mix of males and females, which is awesome. They offer easy and hard versions of all the workout movements and they already have weights from light to heavy set up for us at each station. I love how I don't have to plan my workout, they do it for me and I just get to follow along and I get to learn new movements everyday. You get to do many movements each workout as you move from station to station and they switch it up everyday, so it stays interesting and you get a good mix of cardio and weights. I get an amazing workout and leave sweaty every time. The coaches are all super friendly and very knowledgeable; they motivate us and they come around and correct our form if needed which is super valuable. They are all awesome and have great energy and sometimes even dance to the music, which is hard not to do because the music is sooo good! It's a fun friendly space where members will often high five and chat with each other afterwards, bonding about how hard it was. It's everything you could ever want in a local gym and more :) I highly highly recommend it!",NJrR237DrTCFrUDJINPAQw,Corria P.,90069

This gym in particular was the best decision I made while living in California. It gave me the motivation I needed to work out all while also being a part of a community. The coaches went and still does go over and beyond to reassure you're getting most out of your membership. One big plus for me was that they definitely keep you accountable! For instance, one of the coaches when I first started would text me if I didn't show up on a day I usually come. They did not have to do that but that extra step made a huge difference in me, wanting to be consistent. After a year and half I'm the healthy I've been in awhile and I've maintained that weight loss. I lost in total 21 lbs and gained a lot of valuable foundation to maintain that weight loss. If anyone ever gets a chance to take a class with the head-coach Eric I would hands down recommend it. His energy and character is something else haha and trust me you won't be as annoyed at the fact that you woke up at 5:30AM for a class ever again.",DpV_pFG08zK8479sFKWErg,Samrana B.,90027

After six weeks I saw myself forming abs, and a nicer butt. I loved it so much I have made crossfit part of my life style. The six week challenge included workouts that were pre planned for you. They also really mix up the exercises so you never get bored. We also had a nutritionist come in, Annora, on Sundays to educate us on healthy eating habits. One of the things I like about learning from Annora was the mental aspect to eating healthy and being healthy about eating. Being part of this crossfit team has been a lot of fun because I made some friends and I pushed myself a lot during my workouts. All the trainers are so helpful, and after every run we did they were always there to give you high fives after your runs, and workouts.

I also love how this place is family owned. I just really really really wished that it was a little bit more affordable for specified classes, especially for the are area that is still upcoming and going. For example, it would be a great idea to have class memberships for just spin, or just yoga, etc. But you do get what you pay for and its great here. I had the opportunity to have Arthur as my cycling instructor and he was friendly, motivating and took the time to greet me. I go to sweat cycle in dtla and sometimes you run into those instructors who think they're too important to know they're students (but it is also a facility there). Take this spin class if you're looking to get a good sweat on. Oh, btw, the idea of wearing headsets while spinning threw me off at first, but I then fell in love how intune you get with the instructor and music; rather than the instructor yelling.",uv7m8qV7wHB4EW2inyULfw,Valerie G.,90026

I had no idea how high to adjust my seat, and especially struggled with clipping my shoes in. I had to ask for help from another rider and he came over and adjusted my seat for me. However, at this point, class had already started, the lights had dimmed, and I was still struggling to clip my shoes in. He was so patient and was adamant that I get my shoes clipped in.

First, the rental shoes that were handed to me were particularly dank. I figured it was normal and I did see the workers apply some spray on the other shoes, so I figured it'd be ok. Nope, later that night my foot was swelling up and I apparently contracted a serious skin infection that resulted in a visit to my doc and then the urgent care since it was getting worse. I'm sitting here still healing (not limping as apparently) and my only advice to your business is to make sure you air out your rental shoes and really disinfect them.

She has a wonderful gentle caring approach and integrates mind and body (note the name she has chosen for the studio). She has carefully chosen the most qualified instructors; they come from a background of ballet and dance, stunt work and acrobatics. There are only five reformers so you get individual attention. The instructors are interested in what's best for your unique situation and they inspire you to do your very best.

I decided to get a personal  trainer. And I chose the best !  Moe Sharifi.  What took me so long? I don't know. I have been going to a traditional gym ( not very consistent) for about 7 years with very little to no results.   I have been training with Moe for a little over a month and  the changes that I can see in me are beyond the  scale and measuring tape. But those are nice to see too!  Hello !  I train with him 3 times a week and every session is customized to my body goals. Never boring always challenging. He pushes my physical abilities and demands greatness. Perhaps this has something to do with him being a trained fighting champion himself.  He is very respectful and takes his job very serious which makes me take my sessions with him very serious as well.   Because I am pushed at every session I always leave the gym feeling accomplished and proud of myself.  Thankful.  I am excited  for my physical transformation that is happening now. ,N9gi-5TEZxRVgmTMa-848w,Ebelina S.,91356

I tried contacting them and they replied once and then stopped. I continued to try and contact them and they ""ghosted me."" This was extremely frustrating seeing that I should have gotten a refund of some sort. Very unprofessional.",9hUZkkgwiZrQ5uNeywBILw,Armando F.,90022

The reason why this place has a good star rating is due to making their customers write reviews as part of getting their money back. I lost 21 lbs but gained it back because all that they're doing is strictly keeping you on the KETO diet and of course excercise. If you don't know what the keto diet is, it's low carb food. Look it up and compare to what they're letting you eat in ""their bible."" Basically a scam that I fell for",SVHkOpwgFQAorOUPJzZFbA,Rocio G.,90022

She then went on to say that she wanted me to remove it because she manages the Camps yelp account and that even though my commentary was true she still felt i should remove it so that people can only see that they are perfect and nothing negative ever happens there... I said nope, I'm entitled to my opinions especially being I'm a paid customer who has every right to voice my experiences of what I endured.

,4768 Whittier Blvd,4.0,"Weight Loss,Centers,Boot Camps,Trainers",The Camp Tranformation Center - East LA,48,5,,9/8/2019,"So before I began my journey at the camp I was very depressed, to the point where I was drinking every day just to cope with it. My clothes barely fit me and I was wearing the same pair of jeans all week to work. I had gotten fed up with the situation I was in and didn't know how I was gonna get out. I looked at the journey ahead and dreaded it because I knew it would be a long one and I wasn't sure I had what it takes to see it through. One day I saw an ad about the 20lb challenge and I read into it and I found that for a small deposit I could enroll in a gym that would help me workout, give me a meal plan to follow, and meet some new people with the same goal as me. So I went for it, I didn't know exactly what I was getting into but I was willing to invest in myself and my health. I signed up, attended the seminar, and I purchased all the recommended tools I would need throughout my challenge. This included a digital kitchen scale for my food, a pack of 36 meal prep containers, and some calorie free seasonings and dressings. All on amazon. My experience thus far has been nothing short of incredible! In 6 weeks I lost a total of 30.9 pounds and i am tee rolling for the next challenge to lose an extra 20. Everyone at the camp east LA is a blessing! From the trainers who push me and motivate me, to the front desk staff and my fellow campers who all encourage and inspire me to keep coming back! It's gotten to the point where the camp is something that I look forward to doing in my day and I'm sticking to the meal plan and it's becoming a second nature. My suggestion to anyone who is already thinking about going the camp is to not hesitate! You will be in good hands and the process is 110% proven! Invest in your health! That is the number one investment you can make in your life time!",lKH8aHBrXfe6caAlIx6xgA,Kevin W.,90022

I love the early HIIT class times (5:30AM). The group sessions work best for me. The trainers are elite professionals that put together creative, fun & challenging sessions. All of the trainers are encouraging and inspiring. I have also tried the Cardio HIIT switch class which is 30mins and intense! Allyzon leads the way at 6:30AM. Her playlist is fire!!! In this class, you ""switch"" from bike to mat and perform various core exercises. She also offers a complimentary 10-15 mins after class for yoga/stretching which I enjoy. I love doing both classes and really challenging myself.

I have now basically reached a weight that I was 10 years ago when I use to play basketball and when I use to feel good about myself.  To say it was easy would be a lie.  This is not easy trust me.  You need dedication, disciple, motivation, and most important of all the right coaching staff and gym to put it all together.  The staff is amazing everyone from Chad, to Ana, Dustin, and Sierra to ever single person who walks in and sweats with me.  I dont even consider it a gym anymore honestly to me this is my 2nd family.  Some may think I'm a crazy waking up 4 am to be at the gym 4:45 for my stretching but I actually look forward to my work out days.  Long story short if you are really serious about losing weight and changing your life then come join us.  I am living proof that 168 works and you can do this too!",drmH9MlZlD7a0BvL78SSjA,Hike D.,91214

We can never place ourselves in other people's shoes and expect the same results or opinions. In this case, B Fit works for me and by girlfriend. I'm blown away by her persistence and attention to detail. All too often in this part of Los Angeles I've run into the exact opposite. This is only our second week but I know that this exactly where we need to be to get the results that we've never been able to achieve in a regular gym. She doesn't stop in the sessions, she is persistent with her clients while they are at home. I appreciate what the three trainers bring to the table - there is a great balance between them.

I bought a house in mid-city and was sooooo excited to learn that the Culver studio was opening! This studio opened the week after my doctor cleared me post-pregnancy and I lost all 60 pounds of my pregnancy weight and more. I have to disagree with one of the other posts, there's a very diverse clientele in terms of ages, gender, careers and body types. Every instructor helps you modify if you are new or if you have any physical restrictions. I could not even hold myself up in a plank position a year ago after having a baby and each week different instructors helped me modify and remove/add springs as needed until my core was healed.

After a long search for a group fitness class that would be good for me, I found this place on yelp and decided to check it out. I am familiar with Fit body boot camp as I used to be apart of a different one, so I had an idea of how the workouts were. I wanted to meet Jason in person before I decided to join to see if it was a good fit for me. I made a consultation, which was easy and convenient to do online. Here's what I'll say, Jason is the real deal. He's straightforward, honest and hardworking. He told me how the program worked and the membership rates and didn't pressure me or make me feel bad about my fitness level, (Like other gyms have). I also have injuries I was concerned about and Jason was very understanding about my concerns. After a few weeks of working out here, Its clear to me that Jason is passionate about helping his clients reach their goals. The environment is completely non judgmental and welcoming to people of all fitness levels. Jason is kind and patient, keeps us motivated and helps us one on one with our form. All it takes is 30 minutes a day to make a positive change in your life, and the best part is, each of those 30 minutes is productive! You don't waste anytime, just come, get a great workout and back to your day! I always feel great after.

My core is dramatically stronger, and I have had significantly less sciatica flare-ups. If you have any injuries or stubborn chronic pain, Michellates is your best choice for conscientious workouts that will help you work toward correcting/alleviating those issues. The acute attention to detail, form, and breathing that I have learned working with Michelle has made me more mindful in my daily activities--as I carry a full load of groceries, I think of keeping my shoulders down away from my ears and engaging my lats and serratus, when I sit in a chair without a back rest, I sit up tall on my sit-bones and engage my abs, etc. It's amazing what a body will do for you if you treat it right.

I love him and every staff member!! They are so welcoming and the classes are both during the day and night.

What I love about dancing with Toni is that her movement is so flowing (you can tell that she's danced her whole life). Ang lambot ang katawan. Her tenacity to teach and learn with her students of the process of decolonization of the mind and body is evident in her craft. She often rehearses with telling you the origin of the dance and movement making every dance intentional to its ancestral being. Her expertise of dancing Hula and Filipinx dances invigorates her craft as she has created a space where she can start every class with intentional medication guided with Hawaiian chanting and still represent her Filipinx roots by calling out to her family's origin. She is a patient choreographer and facilitator that is able to communicate how to improve your craft and also, ultimately wants you to improve not only your physical health, but especially your spiritual and mental health. She has advanced traditional movements and put her own twist. Toni has an impeccable resume of dance and even holds a Masters degree dedicated to her craft. You can assure that in any class she teaches will always be meaningful and a life changing experience that goes beyond-to just perform. Her heart is in respecting tradition and deviating from decolonization that awakens every chakra and leaves you in a good mind space following every class by ending with cool downs and meditation with intention. I highly recommend her to achieve your physical goals and her radiant smile and energy will keep you returning. ",oSC-sJJ-rakjd4Q4AqfjOQ,Kathleen Ann S.,90066

Thankfully, there was a free class which I took and honestly, was not impressed. The studio is nice and clean, people are friendly, but the class was meh. It was a beginners' barre class and I am myself a ballroom dancer for ten years but the movements were pretty hard to follow. The temp was speedy so I couldn't keep up with all the movements. It made me feel uncomfortable to be unable to keep the pace up, although it was supposed to be beginners' class :/  well, the most disappointing thing was to see the instructor who just show the movement once/twice and expects the class to repeat. Not sure if it was only me who experienced hard time to follow but not being able to see the instructor taking a lead in class and being lazy is just disappointing.",63JHWeDkPbprl7zjHRvpRw,Inga S.,90014

Then I was introduced to the instructor who explained a bit about the class and what equipment I needed. The session was great, in a good little studio which was nice and clean, the warm up was pretty intense and I definitely felt the burn throughout. The instructor was really encouraging and knew everyone's names, giving hands on corrections and had such great energy.

Wonderful teacher, location, environment, but unlike most of the studios I attend, including ballet, there is much value in having a floor that can be entirely disinfected... Not everyone may agree about the value of a rugless floor, but in my case, I have reactions to rugs and came home with swollen hands. ",OkSgAU06w9KpoT0mDKF0YA,Esther C.,90210

I highly recommend her if you want an instructor that understands your body and know your limit. She constantly tests my strength and motivates me to take care of my body. She teaches me how to do my own exercise routine at home. She's positioned my shoulder and I no longer slouch as I used to when sitting and standing. Pilates is a great way to form and shape your body beautifully and June knows how to put her effort into achieving this. Its therapeutic and pushes you to strengthen your body.

I have never been a big fan of working out, but now I never want to miss one. I even schedule while I'm out of town, so that when I'm back, I get right back in the swing of it. To have a trainer that knows the human body and muscular structure so well, with exercise physiology and biomechanics, is a rare find. Van pays close attention to your ability and always knows what weight you're working with and capable of with every exercise. His knowledge of weight training and proper technique is important to him -- and me -- as my body sometimes looks for the easy way out, which could put stress on your joints and tendons. He loves what he does and I love the results. I no longer have French loaves for arms. They are toned with no wobbly stuff at the bottom (you know what I mean ladies). My bum is firm, and my legs are more shapely. I am stronger then I've ever been -- which is most important to me -- and we are working on strengthening my cardio (my biggest challenge). I cannot say enough great things about Van. There is no way I would push myself the way he does. When I think I can't do any more, he knows I can and guides me through. He is very motivating. It's not an easy workout, but it's always a good one and always different, which I love, because I get bored easily and so do your muscles.  After, I'm rewarded with a cool eucalyptus towel. I call it my dessert. If you want a trainer who gets results and gives you his undivided and personalized attention...Van is your man. He's also a really cool guy.

It's a HIIT workout that combines indoor cycling (aka spinning) and floorwork. Imagine if SoulCycle and Barry's had a baby. Half of the class is purely spinning and the other half is floorwork. I absolutely loved it! The spinning is a great way to get cardio while also incorporating major core work. The floorwork was pretty standard. We did weighted sumo squats, front lunges, single leg deadlifts, etc. Perfect combination of you ask me!",lS-wxXFJWxVdbA1OAJDFRg,Joanna S.,90026

I was told it was a nice combo of my two favorite activities - Barry's and spinning - and I did not leave disappointed. It's located in a nondescript shopping complex with ample parking, so don't worry about that. The front area is very inviting, mostly used for personal training, and the front desk staff was very willing to answer any questions about the class. The space is small - besides for the front personal training room and the room where the classes are in, there is a small back space for cubbies, a bathroom, and a shower. Everything is clean and well-organized. ",OkYOcEI2cgrc_U3iwel4jQ,Emily P.,90026

We've been taking classes with Seth since his Barry's days and were so excited to check out his new gym and Spindigo classes. Needless to say, it's been over a year and we've been back practically every day since for both Spindigo and personal training with Seth. Indigo is a beautiful, spotlessly clean gym with everything you need to stay fit. The Spindigo classes are half circuit training with weights and half spin class. It's such a great balance and a way to stay strong while avoiding some of the joint pain/wear and tear I was feeling on the treadmill. Seth is great, of course, but we love the other instructors too. The vibe at Indigo is so full of positivity and the staff and other clients are genuinely just so nice!  I couldn't recommend Indigo more.

As a woman trying to learn how to lead I'm especially grateful to find an instructor willing to teach me the part that is traditionally for men. The studio she teaches at is also queer friendly.  You also won't find a better package deal on private lessons with a professional instructor at her level in Los Angeles.

Betina was understanding of my injury and my hate of working out, yet did not let me use that as an excuse to take it easy. She pushed and encouraged me to believe I could do better and lift more. Even when I complained, and let me tell you I complained and gave looks that could kill, she always had a happy demeanor that did not come off as forced.

ANYWAYYYY, on my first visit to LIFT, I was hoping to find a new fitness routine that I loved - and I wasn't disappointed. I trained with Dirk my first session. I had never devoted any time or money to actual weight training, aside from a bundle of Gold's Gym training sessions I was pressured into purchasing when I first moved to LA. I think I bough five sessions and only redeemed two. It just wasn't my thing. Gyms are such a scene and I prefer to work really hard and get the hell out of there. Basically, I was on the ""do cardio, stay as thin as possible"" former chubby girl cycle of fitness. When I filled out my new LIFT member questionnaire, I wrote ""I would love to come here twice a week, but not sure I can make the financial commitment right now."" It's been five weeks and I have been faithfully attending twice a week. When it's this good, you just find the money. So I don't order postmates as much, who cares?? Chenelle and Dirk run this gym in such a way that working out becomes more than a physical obligation. It's fun. It's something I look forward to. Also, I just like them! I look forward to seeing them and working with them to become a stronger version of myself. Everyone is there to kick their own ass fr 30 minutes. There's no ""LA gym"" pretentiousness"" with LIFT.

Maybe it was too much cardio, not enough weights, or maybe it didn't engage my core as much as I wanted to. However, every time I've been to Burn60, I always feel like I've pushed myself to my limit AND more. The instructors are great, with clear instructions and tips on how to perfect your form, the studio is clean with amenities such as hair ties, a water bottle on your first class, etc. However, I feel that what really makes Burn60 worth it is the extra push I get when I'm on the treadmill. Hate is a strong word, so let's just say I strongly dislike running, especially on treadmills. But in Burn60, with the instructor leaning over your shoulder yelling at you to turn up the pace, that's an excellent motivator to go faster than you ever thought you could.

Which is an important factor in everyone's busy lifestyle today specially considering how everyone always makes an excuse how they don't have time to workout. I personally wake up at 5am every morning for the 6am class and there is no better way to start my day. It gets my blood flowing and the serotonin in my body pumping and puts me in a mood to conquer the rest of my work day, giving me the jump start I need in the mornings to be fully alert, awake and ready to conquer whatever the day has to throw my way. However you look at it, Burn60 has being a life changing factor for me, not only changing the way I live but also keeping me in the healthiest best shape of my life considering the toxic lifestyle LA life throws at us we all need it.",_VFiV-yxSjpo3RSwgjCfeQ,Jonathan P.,90049

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use. We will provide disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer to all members.",2306 Hyperion Ave,5.0,"Trainers,Boot Camps,Weight Loss,Centers",Velocity Boot Camp,35,5,Silver Lake,1/20/2020,"I was first introduced to Velocity Boot Camp in June, 2019 when I took a free one-week trial class. I had been looking for a gym to join, but wasn't sure ""boot camp"" was the right fit. I leaned more towards yoga and walking, but was open to something more rigorous that could provide resistance and strength training. Matt's class did not disappoint! I was sore for at least two weeks and cursed having to get up at 6:30am to get to the 7am class, but here I am - 7 months later - a devout fan & addict. I am healthier, stronger, and have more stamina. Those heavy, Costco-sized bags of dog food? No problem. I just toss 'em in my cart.  Matt is a super nice guy and has designed a challenging yet do-able program that delivers 100%.",bJ50cquUC_OYg81400zKXQ,Pamela T.,90027

-New Guidelines-

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use.

Now I go to maintain my weight and build muscle and strength. I've seen a significant improvement in my overall physique, especially my abs, arms and chest. Every day is a different set of aerobic exercises and resistance training, so you get a good full-body workout every week.  It's become my regular morning routine.

The studio had a good mix of equipment, medicine balls, dumbbells, exercise balls, boxes, etc. It's fast paced and they don't cool the room so you work up a big sweat quickly.

It's one of those classes that you have to come often to figure out the routine. I was the only new comer in the class and it was pretty obvious, which was okay. I didn't find it awkward.

I was shocked & surprised by this as I have taken class here several times before and the class has started 10 min late. To be fair this policy is listed, but like many I have been coming here for years and don't know when this copy got listed or if I never read the fine print before... but I think 5 min strict policy in LA is really unreasonable. 10 min would make more sense. And add to the waiver that people should arrive prepared for class any injury outside of that they are not responsible for... because they say missing the warm up is the reason, but this warm up is not extensive. As a regular excerciser it does almost nothing for my body before this class other than light stretching and loosening of joints. Worse, when I tried to convey this feedback about 5 min not being enough leniency with traffic in LA (as kindly as possible) I was met with defensive explanation rather than acceptance of this feedback. Great customer service would have been to acknowledge my frustration, acknowledge noting my feedback and then explaining that it is studio policy and here is why... but I should have been made to feel like a valued client that was listened to and whose opinions were considered. Unfortunately, the opposite of that occurred and that really makes me question whether I want to continue here going forward",JDiXPf3PFXGuKJhugx5T5A,Allison L.,90069

Been teaching me about this fitness life since five years ago and recently She got me back on track with fitness in the third trimester of pregnancy, I was letting myself go and sedentary for the most part, gestational diabetes, bad diet and all that. I'm so glad I had those last few months training with Gia, doing workouts and cardio to get me moving, eating healthy. She was even there when I went in labor! Pretty epic! Now looking back I did it for me and my baby girl and I can't thank her enough. Cant wait to get cleared and start training again and  proud of her for having a platform to help people during this pandemic! If she has openings I highly recommend you lock them in. Her virtual sessions are like having her there with you. She is good about correcting your form to make sure you don't get injured and you get the best workout so your time is well spent. Also I love that she puts a lot of emphasis on diet which is soooo important, will check in with what you're eating and drinking and I like how she explains what's happening in your body in a way that you can understand, she's a very good teacher. Gia is highly motivating and still approachable and not intimidating which is great for beginners and she is also tough and will push you, which is great for people that are athletic but just off track, and need coaching to help them level up. Im so grateful we met, Gia introduced me to a lifestyle of fitness and self care. I was athletic as a kid but as an adult I fell into crash dieting, didn't understand how things worked, always eating too little or too much and not truly taking care of myself so that I could feel good on the inside with some healthy goals in place. I like that Gia digs deep and focuses on the persons overall well being, mind, body and spirit and I'm positive that every person that has ever worked with her has felt an overall transformation. Having a trainer like her is so valuable and will add years to your life. Definitely worth the investment. She's the best at what she does and she makes it fun!!",ezeNR79AyHxrMRTW9UwG4g,Tiffany Y.,90266

"Personal Training, Bootcamps, Nutrition, Spinning, Sports Endurance Training, Zumba, Injury Rehab",4005 Highland Ave,5.0,"Trainers,Boot Camps,Cycling Classes",Body By Gia,10,5,,11/19/2017,"Those of us who spend our lives focusing on helping others end up not focusing on ourselves much. After 2 elections/re-elections and 2 back to back campaigns, my health (physical and mental) and weight finally took the final beating. I had gained almost 20 pounds, I had severe back pain and had to stop running, and felt depressed, hopeless and lethargic. I blamed age, my lifestyle and stress for my ""inability"" to lose weight and eat healthy. Then I met Gia Fey. She had such an amazing spirit and energy and wasn't the typical ""fitness"" trainer one tends to encounter. She was about loving yourself first, educating yourself about nutrition and working out last (but hitting it hard when you do). I didn't know much about Gia or her approach to fitness but I knew her energy was infectious and she had a banging body, so I sent her an email that dripped in desperation and anxiety and I asked if she could help me. Not only did she say ""of course"" but she also said, your situation is not unique. She emphasized that I wasn't alone. We met and the transformation began. I've had my ups and downs. Being fit and healthy isn't just about being ""skinny"", it's also about your mind, body, and soul. I'll admit, this is probably much easier now since I don't have to keep a campaign lifestyle anymore, but I don't travel less, I don't spend less time focusing on helping others, and between all my ""jobs,"" I spend just as much time working as I did before. I'm almost where I want to be physically, but I'm already there mentally and emotionally and I have @bodybygia to thank. If you want something bad enough (or have reached the point of being sick and tired of being sick and tired), there isn't anything that can stop you.

Such high energy and enthusiasm, takes the time to learn everyone's name. This is what a boot camp class should be like. Also SUCH a good workout...like 1000X more intense than when I work out on my own. She has a combination of bootcamp and spinning. Also she corrects form, which is really important and I've worked out with other fitness instructors who don't do that. Also the price is super reasonable, there seems to be a nice camaraderie among the people going, all in all a great experience. Also great for people of all fitness levels  - she goes out of her way to make sure the class isnt intimidating. Highly recommend - esp for people in highland park or el sereno (since as far as I could tell this is one of the only bootcamps out there).",xcWZG6Y2VG5oHIpFalfWdg,Deb K.,90266

Gia never let me give up and never put me in danger. I have trained with male trainers and prefer Gia's method by far because I know she will never compromise my safety but she helped me reach my goals. She is an excellent teacher and is so invested in her clients success. She influenced many positive lifestyle changes including cutting out alcohol! Overall she got me the results I desired but more importantly taught me that a healthy lifestyle and proper nutrition is what will help me maintain.,-i2GRkKrhR-8JLIxFx5lGw,Melany Z.,90266
