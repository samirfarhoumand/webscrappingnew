High intensity group fitness with an Aussie twist!,7825 Santa Monica Blvd,5.0,"Boot Camps,Interval Training,Gyms",Training Mate West Hollywood,168,3,,3/24/2019,"I checked out TM via class pass. Took Reuben's class a week ago, and recall there being a warm-up prior to starting stations. I took Ash's class yesterday, but there was no warm-up, which I found odd. Anyway, the only reason I went to TM is because I had to work in the morning and could not make it to my usual training spot on time. I will have to say, in comparison to other HIIT places, TM is not really challenging. If you're barely getting into HIIT you might like it, but for someone who's already done it for over a year it may be a bit of a bore. I honestly did not really break a sweat both times I went, and was not really challenged by the variety of weight options. ",mqMeo-UenRzZQLyXuH-PFQ,Ana S.,90046

He really got me exactly where I wanted to be so fast. I came in with no experience in anything.

I told Salar how I wanted my body to look and in a few months, and expectations were surpassed. My waist is the smallest it's ever been, I have abs!, and a booty! Most importantly, I feel good. I can run miles and not feel like I'm dying now. He taught me how to meal plan and prep. He was so attentive and really focused on my every move to make sure I didn't hurt myself. He was extremely patient with me. There would be days where I would tell him I hated him with almost every rep but he kept the workouts fun and kept me going with his encouragement.

"CFGH specializes in CrossFit, its methodologies, and its simplicity - which is why we are so effective. We also are highly effective at coaching other sports such as powerlifting, weightlifting and Strongman.

CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide. Also, moms, dads, students and other everyday athletes looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The CrossFit program is designed for universal scalability making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. We've used our same routines for elderly individuals with heart disease and cage fighters one month out from televised bouts. The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind, so we scale load and intensity based on the needs and capabilities of the individual athlete.

As a result, our program delivers a fitness that is, by design, broad, general, and inclusive. Our specialty is not specializing.

"CFGH specializes in CrossFit, its methodologies, and its simplicity - which is why we are so effective. We also are highly effective at coaching other sports such as powerlifting, weightlifting and Strongman.

CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide. Also, moms, dads, students and other everyday athletes looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The CrossFit program is designed for universal scalability making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. We've used our same routines for elderly individuals with heart disease and cage fighters one month out from televised bouts. The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind, so we scale load and intensity based on the needs and capabilities of the individual athlete.

I've been on both sides of the spectrum, a fragile and alarming 86 pounds on a 5 '4 frame to a staggering and bone aching  170 . I restricted and deprived myself of joy and self love  and the other binged uncontrollably and indulged in access. Not being able to find a balance made me feel out of control.

My sister even noticed a difference in my leg proportions after training with Mila and I couldn't be happier with my results. Workouts are fun with great music and there is a lot of stretching involved so you are rarely sore. I assumed I was rarely sore because I wasn't getting enough of a workout in only to go to yoga after a haitus and realize I was even stronger than when I had done intense HIIT training.

Â If you wake up at the crack of dawn for a 5:30am class, stand around in the dark and cold and no one shows up to open or teach you can expect a brief email later that day letting you know you can take another class some other time. Â If you pay $25 to sign up for a class and wake up with the flu you can expect to pay the $25 for the class you are too sick to take plus another $25 for not showing up. Â Plus they rely on technology for all client transactions; there is no one to talk to, just emails to anonymous addresses which can feel like communicating with bots. Â On top of that their technology is glitchy and often down but if there is any human error on your part don't expect any leniency.

I would give his energy 2/5 stars. The room is insanely hot. They have 1 fan for the whole studio vs SF, that has at least three fans. All of their mirrors were completely fogged up and you could smell the sweat in the room. The front desk girl had to come open the back door. This should tell their studio they should do some improvements. I was wearing red pants and my pants were filthy from their weights. I put the weights down and had black all over my hands.

Whatever you do, take this class. I cannot recommend this class or company enough. I'm still talking and thinking about the class and we took it almost a month ago. Another reviewer said this class gives you a false sense of safety because now you think you can beat up anyone. I couldn't disagree more. In no world do I think I can get myself out of any situation, but suddenly, I have a lot more choices than I thought I did. This class made me realize how women (I know men have issues with men, but I'm a woman, so I'm coming at it from my perspective) are rarely rude to men we don't want contact from. We smile, we walk away (which is always preferable in a dangerous situation, so don't think they teach you to not get away), we sometimes don't listen to our gut instinct and intuition and that is was it actually dangerous. It is okay for my daughter to be rude (and get into the ready position) if some guy asks her for directions and then starts on about how beautiful she is, how old are you, all that crap we've all had to listen to all these years of being women. It teaches you how to USE YOUR VOICE! I hope I never have to use the skills they taught me, but at least I have them now. Also, I recommend reading the book, ""The Gift of Fear"" by Gavin DeBecker. Empower yourself, empower your daughters and sons. Even though only my daughter took the class with me, I came home and told my 10 year old about it and gave him some thoughts on if a stranger approaches him, etc. It opens up a dialogue with your children and that is so important! It was sobering when my daughter said to me, ""I've never once been rude to a guy who has tried to talk to me while walking, or at a store"" etc. And, that is crazy. She gets hit on all the time by adult men and she is 14. Take this class. Trust your instincts. Stop being polite (that's me talking). Talk with your children - male and female. Teach them what is appropriate and what is not right. I cannot tell you how much I loved this class.",FRAaSv1NMzxWXqjenEgIgg,Rachel Q.,90093

I have never been the petite dainty type despite growing up believing that's what I wanted. Instead I learned to embrace and love what I have and worked instead to define and sculpt my curves. At some point, I was having people ask me how they could tone their legs like mine! She made me strong physically and feel so mentally as well. I avoided the gym for years before her, never comfortable with it or myself until I decided to try training and found her and inner strength I never knew I had. She'll push you, probably with a smile on her face, and maybe a slightly evil laugh too, but she knows what she is doing. Seriously. She knows.

I've done a lot of workouts in NYC and LA. I like boxing, but I never feel like it really focuses on my muscles like pilates does, but then pilates doesn't burn the calories I need to eat ice cream every week. HIIT is nice but often gets boring to me (and I don't like to be yelled at!). Then I found MDR. First of all, just come in and see the girls and guys who are in these classes. They all have KILLER bodies. Long, lean with the line going down the bellies for the perfect abs. (How hard is it to carve that line?!) Second, the effects are almost immediate. I am telling you, if you start going here every other day, in two weeks, you'll see such a difference in your body it is unbelievable. Third, every workout is different, so it never gets boring. Plus, instructors have good playlists. Finally, finally, the people who work here make it the best! They are so understanding, remember your name, are funny as heck, and make the whole experience perfect. Thank you, MDR; I miss you already and it's only been a day! P.S.

Â Bicycling, hiking, dieting, etc. Â I always end up hitting a routine hard for a couple of months. Â But then I run into the inevitable wall. Â I just don't really know where to go from there. Â I get some results. Â But I'm not able to direct my progress. Â I start to tread water, not progressing. Â Not evolving physically. Â And eventually I get frustrated and give up. Â I'd been wanting try something different. Â People always talk about physical trainers, but it seemed like something that was out of reach. Â So I decided to give Rob atÂ Open Sky a try. Â I'd heard wonderful things. Â I started an 8 week challenge and it has been amazing. Â I'm on my second round. Â I've been having improvements in flexibility and stamina, weight loss and muscle tone. Â And I've been feeling better physically and mentally - more energy, more focused. Â As another reviewer mentioned: Rob tailors each workout to the person. Â I have back pain and lack of movement from a previous injury. Â He looks out for his trainees. Â Assesses their abilities. Â And creates a bespoke routine for improvement. I never feel like Rob is going to force an exercise that will aggravate my issues. Â He has an elastic program that fits each individual he trains. Â After the first 8 weeks of training I felt like I'd been physically upgraded. Â  I was stoked to continue working out! Â I've had several people ask if I've lost weight and/or been sleeping better. Â I know the workouts are helping me change. So I'll be continuing w Rob. Â Stay tuned for updates!",0xKyDDeTl1HdxBPpIYhJ6Q,Jeremy C.,90046

His personal training program was customized to fit me. I'm happy to say that after working with Rob I dropped my weight 10 pounds, I lost 2 inches off my waist and my cholesterol was back to normal. Needless to say my doctor was shocked and asked what I did. Do yourself a favor and hire Rob! He genuinely cares and will go the extra mile to help you.",irpLU-nDcKhw4eRkv8Vu7Q,Anthony T.,90046

I began working with Rob and Devon having been totally skeptical that as a parent of two kids who works full time, I would be able to exercise and change my eating habits on a regular basis. I was completely convinced after 8 weeks, and continue to this day doing on this program. Rob is clear, warm and approachable, but also has high expectations for everyone he works with. He designed workouts that were varied, manageable, fun and challenging. Best of all, each workout was only 20 minutes each day, so there's just no excuse not to make time. Working with him changed my lifestyle in so many ways - from waking up early each day and working out, to being more mindful of what I eat, to helping my family make better health choices. Rob and Devon are also both realistic - they encourage and push (in the nicest ways) but also give you permission to take care of yourself, not feel the need to be perfect, and do the best you can in any given circumstance. They are both incredibly responsive and did everything to answer even the smallest question. I highly recommend Open Sky Fitness to everyone as a way to gain an understanding of what you need to live the healthiest life you can, no matter what your current situation.",4lfPrgkrbHc-JvkvZWPbGA,Sara L.,90046

When I came to him, I was mentally depressed and incredibly frustrated that the workouts I was doing were not producing any results. I was not overweight but I was not building muscle and my joints were constantly inflamed and in pain. Rob not only taught me how to work out effectively, he taught me how to do it safely. He is the guy that the other trainers go to in the gym when they can't figure out what is wrong with their clients form and how to correct it - I'm not joking, this happened multiple times during our workouts. His way of working out is directed not only towards results, but also towards longevity. I can't stress how important that is or how wonderful it has been for me. He knows the body, how it works and what it needs to perform at it's best. He guides you in a way that makes sense and makes you feel in control of yourself and your body.

It's hard to find a gym where women can feel comfortable enough to use all the equipment that's provided or even ask for help if needed. They also have women group sessions! So if you feel a little bit intimidated to do a one on one class you can do a group class. Also, Byanka will help you with meal plans, supplements and more.

I'm a bit shy and a bit intimidated by male dominated places but I thought maybe I'll call and see if they've got female trainers. So I took the first step to try something new, Â called and yes! There is a female trainer, she was put on the phone and I started asking questions. What kind of classes should I try if I have zero on top of zero experience (unless you count tae-bo from the 90s)? She recommends a couple difference classes meant for beginners and possibly with her teaching so I may feel less intimidated being the only female. She gives a couple different days and times, st which I take note and say 'ok, thank you for your help! Maybe I'll try the Tuesday morning class sometime"".

Classes for beginners and advanced",1234 North La Brea Ave,5.0,"Muay Thai,Brazilian Jiu,jitsu,Kickboxing",KINGS MMA - West Hollywood,22,5,,8/2/2017,"So my personal trainer recommended that I do some martial arts to recover my balance and strength from my old ice hockey injuries and improve my cardio. He noticed that Kings MMA was up the street and he insisted I check it out. I am used to seeing sparring since my younger brother is a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I had some exposure to martial arts earlier in my life. However, I have no experience with either Muay Thai or Jiu Jitsu. I was super excited to try them out! Now, I am a girl, and generally expect to see in contact sports more guys than girls (which isn't an issue for me) but I was happy to see some fellow ladies in class woo hoo! In Muay Thai, Coach Vinnie and Coach Steve are very patient with me being such a clumsy noob and even laugh because well I think it's hilarious to hop around and kick and punch. What can I say it's entertaining. There are varying degrees of experienced students in class which helps someone like me learn as I can get correction as needed. I have also been starting Jiu Jitsu and Leandro was very helpful. He got in right away to help the students learn how to pose in a fight and started teaching maneuvers the first day which were challenging but fun. We got to spar as well and I could not stop laughing. I literally have a blast! The cost of the classes is extremely reasonable for the amount of days a week you can go as well as the times available. I would recommend going during morning sessions if you are a super noob like me because there are less students and you will get more attention. If you are looking to continue your education then you are probably safe to do a later class. Either way I highly recommend Kings MMA!!!",xussYYBykfHhpIdSBsGI_Q,Maureen J.,90038

I joined Sandbox 3 years ago, right around the time they first opened up. From the start, I felt very comfortable and not intimidated by the classes or workouts. All of the instructors are very encouraging, kind, and since class sizes are smaller, I got more individual attention/corrections on my technique. Also, not to mention you get the workout in the sand and feel like you are at the beach. Its a prime location because although thw beach is not too far away from the SF Valley, LA traffic is insane and this gym helps you get a full-body beach/sand workout without the long drive! Not only that, but you have amazing and kind instructors to help you meet your personal body goals. You also burn more calories working out in the sand, so sometimes I would still see results and improvements days after one class! Its awesome! My favorite instructors are Jessica, Tonni, and Minna. They each bring something completely different to each class, but its great because it keeps workouts new and challenging!",m05mf7h7VWIDGec1uwh1Tg,Sydni P.,91423

I've done intense bootcamps in the past and love the camaraderie associated with this type of tough workout but Guy takes it to a whole new level. His extensive knowledge in all areas of health, from fitness and nutrition to good postural alignment are extremely impressive. He takes the time to address any poor form he sees during the workout (instead of letting you ""power through"" pathetic push-ups or bad burpees like many bootcamp trainers will let you do!) He shows the importance of good form so that you DON'T get injuries or limitations (or worsen the ones you already have).

Â I like the emphasis on moving your body the way it was meant to move, rather than with artificial and fancy machines. Â I like the routine of it all and the fact that everyone is there to work hard, not look good. Â I'm not so into the weighing and measuring of body fat, nor the nutritional advice. Â I'm there to work out, build muscle mass and stamina, and to sleep well.

I do not respond well to super-intense, boot-camp-style stuff. But this year I decided it was really time to add strengthening into my routine, and I heard the reformer was the way to go. So, after reading all the great reviews on here, I decided to try a private session at Wunda. I figured at least I'd only be embarrassed/miserable in front of one person. But I was neither of those things! Anna was welcoming, supportive, informative, and fun. She gave me the confidence to try the group classes next. Highly recommend an initial private session to get the lay of the land, and definitely recommend Anna as an instructor!",go7G0Xh5mXXoJNJO-ggkcg,Lyssa D.,90027

For the first year or so, I only went once or twice a week, but as I started to progress and get better, I decided it was time to take the plunge and purchase an unlimited membership. It was so worth it! Now, I go religiously to the 7am classes 5 days a week. The more frequently you're able to go to class, the better your results will be, but even when I was just going twice a week I could feel myself getting stronger. You don't have to be a pro or have any previous Pilates experience; the instructors will meet you where you're at and work with you to help you progress over time. Just be sure to let them know if you have any injuries or what your level of experience is. When I first started, I could hardly hold a plank on the reformer without taking a break every couple of seconds, but now I can complete an entire planking series with ease. The instructors here are great (although I really miss Nancy's 7am classes!) Ricardo always manages to kick my butt and make my laugh during class. Stephanie (the owner) was the first instructor I ever had there, and she has been a great motivator for me over the years. Bisi likes to try all sorts of new things in her classes, and she always has the perfect music-- lots of late 90s/early 2000s hip-hop and R&B (and some of my fav Destiny's Child tracks). Ashley is a great motivator and keeps things fun, even when you're sweating a ton. I use the Club Pilates app to book all of my classes, which is super easy to use and guarantees that I always get into the classes I want. They also have fun challenges and events throughout the year, like the Friends Fit Challenge. I've made several friends there over the years, and it's definitely a great community to be a part of.

Christian was impressively well prepared to create a work out routine that gives you the most bang for your buck both financially and calorically. They also have you wear this heart monitor which I didn't think would work but blew me away with its accuracy. You can measure your results, your calories burned, and the number of minutes that you have spent in cardiovascular zones 4 and 5 as you work out so that you understand your results down to the detailed math and you don't walk away with a false sense of achievement just because you're sweaty (I'm talking to YOU, hot yoga). Plus, the trainers are just nice affable super respectful guys. As a female, I really appreciated their vibe AND their expertise. -Miriam",zGYOmv5hKUjQdZI8JLh9Jw,FoodieChic K.,90048

In the workouts, there was a perfect balance of training with my own body weight, weightlifting and the use of machines in the gym. His advice, his critiques, his motivation and his knowledge really pushed me in such a positive way. The day before I first trained with him for a full session, I was at 167 lbs. Three months later and I am at 142 lbs! Losing these first 25 lbs seemed absolutely impossible on my own. I was very unmotivated but knew I needed a kick in the butt, so to speak, and I needed to start working with someone who would guide me in the right direction.

I go here almost everyday to get in a full-body workout. Before M/Body I used to do HIIT classes that resulted in me hurting myself (shin splints, plantar fasciitis, knee injuries and more) while engaging in unhealthy competition instead of enjoying the workout and having fun. I realized that if I can't do an exercise when I'm 90, I probably shouldn't be doing it now. Here, people come of all ages from 14 to 70 (or even older!) M/BODY is an intense workout that can be modified for your specific needs. You're encouraged to modify any exercise that doesn't feel right for your body. That's the best thing about this place: you get to be part of a beautiful community of mostly women who are amazing and lift each other up and you get to be YOU. That spirit trickles down from Marnie who pushes us to our limits all while smiling and being happy. It has shifted how I view my workout from dread and competition to happiness and joy. Every word out of Marnie's mouth is something that has made me into a better human. That's where the spiritual growth comes in. Her class will change your life and push you past your limits while empowering you and lifting up your self-esteem. ALL the instructors here are amazingly talented: Kate, Kayla, Lauren and Kiara all push you and support you in their own unique ways with their own unique music and personalities. They are invested in the clients and their well-being during and after class. No matter how you feel before class, you'll leave feeling good about yourself and in just a few weeks your body will start changing and your legs and bottom will never have looked better!

I am a fan of cardio, and she easily mixes in cardio sprints with weights and core toning exercises. It's an overall body workout that challenges, but doesn't exhaust. Â If you want to find a motivating instructor and a fun group workout, try D Method. Diana rocks! Highly recommended for busy women.",VwatXGWMBy3f5d-wONvHTA,Heather M.,90025

She really listens to you to get a good background of where you've been, and asks specifics about your goals to find out ways to get you where you want to be. Her workouts are fun but let me tell you, I am in very good cardio shape but haven't strength-trained in months, and I was truly sore for four days after we met.

I have a couple of pains doing certain moves and Britta either does adjustments or comes back to them later when I've gotten stronger. Super convenient location across from the Paramount Studios lot and has a second location on Larchmont. She's flexible, understanding, and more importantly a cheerleader.

Strength Rx helped kicked my body into high gear! As an older women who is a former athlete of well over 2 decades ago, I felt it was nearly impossible to get my body and health back. I was wrong- the coaches at Strength RX, kicked my butt and literally in 8 weeks, this happened! I started on a "" Free Trial"" but that came with a fee- you don't meet body fat- you loose money but it went towards membership...I felt this was worth it. You get comprehensive meal plans and if you are new to fitness, I strongly encourage following them. ( you can use so many spices, peppers etc to flare up your meals) This gym is a 40 min commute for me- I still try to make it work, because it is that good! The coaches are great, you eventually get to know each one and what their stye of teaching is. I stopped going for 5 months because of 1 month of travel and work issues but just got back on. Let me tell you, no matter your fitness level- YOU CAN DO THIS! There is every body shape and size, don't worry! You start with ""Burn Classes"" everyone in this class is beginners with little to no knowledge or someone that has been doing it and can high five you to get you pumped- So do not be intimated! If you can't do a particular exercise, speak up! Coaches are more than happy to help modify for you or, if are like me and have old sports injuries- IT IS OK! They are not going to make you max out and make you feel bad. This becomes a community, we all help each-other.I just came back after 5 months on a truly free trial to give feedback and I will keep you posted! They genuinely seemed to care what members feel.

I am coming into my second week of training at F45. What can I say? After the one week trial I got hooked. I was on the lookout for a new place to call my training home as my old place abruptly shut down. Anyway, walking into the place for the first time I honestly was impressed by their state of the art equipment and screens that guide you through each workout station. Unlike other HIIT places where the trainers give you the run through of the workout once, and will only walk around sparingly, the F45 team make sure to check for form and make any adjustments to prevent injury. In addition, they will challenge you if they notice you're a beast :), which I greatly appreciate. The coaches are extremely welcoming, I have taken classes with Gaby, Will, Chelsea, Greg, Michael and Peter. ",mqMeo-UenRzZQLyXuH-PFQ,Ana S.,90038

This is the perfect box to start at... And continue long-term. There are so many things here that have kept me coming consistently since the day I started. First and foremost, it is the sense of community. Everyone is so welcoming, the coaches and other members, and you never feel out of place. This box caps their classes at 12 people (lift only classes are capped at 6 or 7) which allows for the coaches to see everyone, and adjust/correct your form, which is so valuable in Crossfit. Everyone, including myself, is afraid that I will get injured but I have no doubt I am in good hands with the supervision and expertise of all of the coaches. They also organize a social calendar that keeps all of the members engaged and feeling like a family. Most members have been here for 2+ years. They keep their place clean, have two bathrooms, and a really nice shower (bring your own towel). I've never felt so confident at a new gym and new extremely unfamiliar workouts. Every single class is different, you are always being challenged and learning something new, and you are always having fun with it, even if it's painful. I have totally been sucked in to this community and I love every second of it! Join this box if you are considering Crossfit, I promise it's worth it.",TkYMJnYuVUZ-SsEYVZCCRg,Tiffany R.,90036

Â When you sign up, they tell you that you can pause your membership at any time for $50. This is a lie. They offered to pause my membership on March 1st (I made the request at the beginning of February) basically telling me I had no choice but to wave goodbye to the money I had already paid for the month of February. It's bad enough that they charge you $50 to pause a membership, but they then restrict your ability to pause it to only one day per month, and then they lie to you about it when you sign up.

After having experienced a few other boxes, I've realized a few things unique to this place. The programming is OUTSTANDING. Fun and results driven which is a hard line to follow. The energy of the members, in my humble opinion, is unmatched and so, SO motivating. The coaches. Enough said. They rock. All of them. So technically sound and personally invested. I love this place.

Â Luke, my nutritional coach, who implemented intermittent fasting-a new concept along with a meal plan. Coach Deviny who orchestrated constantly getting me setup, enrolled and ready to train. My results are losing roughly 30 pounds, I started at 273 pounds and now I'm 243 pounds in just a few months. Even with Arthritis concerns, it felt good to participate, compete, and complete workouts. Many times I found myself being a leader at each event and that made me feel good, like an athlete training again. No workout was exactly the same which increased my movement, strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular. Lastly, perhaps being around the new Lakers facility, helped to create a friendly competition of bowling, rowing, or versa climbing.",h65AmoZ8Lfxb_L0RXh4EBw,Amon A.,90245

The people here are great. The prices are super reasonable. I came to a couple Saturday morning classes and everyone is so supportive. I was a little nervous because the first time I went, I came alone. I have absolutely no experience so I was scared I was going to look like an idiot. Everyone made me feel so at home. There are a few exercises you go through where you partner up with people and everyone I was paired with was super friendly and willing to help me if I had questions about the form. People range in skill level as well so I didn't feel too far behind. The family that runs the classes is so sweet and upbeat. They're happy to pop by and help you out. I brought a few of my friends one time that had absolutely no interest in boxing and all of them had a really fun time. Two of them continued coming back each Saturday. My only gripe was that the Saturday morning class is insanely crowded, but that's just normal LA. You will be dripping in sweat by the end of the hour. Since my classes, I joined a gym that offered free boxing classes with my membership, so I felt bad spending money outside of that, but idk . . . recently I've been wanting to go back.",iDhkqbfV9du4DY5mQsdh2A,Rachel K.,91403

I went to one class and was underwhelmed bc they have beginners and intermediates mixed in. First class was one instructor teaching students on multiple apparatuses. Which is frustrating if you're just there to learn silks you have to wait your turn and watch the instructor teach other students on apparatuses you don't care to learn which a waste of time to me. Second class were 9 students beginners and intermediates as well as adults and teens. My suggestion would be separate the beginners and intermediates or the teens and adults, all the teens were bored and incredibly distracting when the instructor was teaching trapeze and hammock and since the class was so big we didn't even get to the silks. I felt very frustrated having wasted $30 not learning anything I wanted to learn and instead felt like I was in some after school program watching kids learn and run around the trapeze. Needless to say I won't be coming back here. If you're new and learning I recommend going somewhere else. I hear Womack and Bowman have great classes but haven't been to one yet.",j7ol3870TGcNwGUKGVR5Pg,Sarai S.,90041

The best part about FR 180 is that we don't have the same workout sessions every session, it's something new every single time. I am already seeing great results with such a short period of time and can't wait to see more results as I continue the program. Oh and let's not forget about the pricing, I have shopped around for such sessions but couldn't afford anything due to high pricing at different fitness centers, by far NO ONE CAN BEAT PATRYCJA WITH PRICING AND THE WORKOUT WE GET FOR THE PRICE WE PAY!!!!

I've notice how much stronger my punches and kicks have gotten since I started taking classes with Sheila. The classes are challenging, but that's exactly why I go. Other group based cardio classes can be a workout, but it doesn't teach anything about basic self-defense. I love the fact that fact that I'm sweating from start to finish. The 10 minutes before and after making use of your boxing gloves are my favorite. Those exercises focus on different muscles every day, but they leave me feeling the burn the next day.

Both Sue and Patricia are excellent teachers with radiant healthy energy. My hips have become liberated and limber from the workouts. I have a defined center of balance and hold myself with dignity because of the work out. I relish the 'zen frog' pose which provides me with defined safe space both physically and mentally. Summoning zen frog in crowded situations has calmed and centered me. I like it that the classes are not crowded. The practice has helped me with emotional stress when I had no one to share what I was going through. It is also fun because I don't sweat and the water supports my the weight of my body which is definitely more limber and stronger as a result. H2Yoga has been a real blessing and has improved the quality of my life. Thank you.,KsP4rk3u2HfV6UlhLsn5_Q,Jane E.,90036

She hadn't tried the challenge but we were both very curious and pumped up about getting fit and getting advice so that we could work out better and learn about fitness. The link did not provide many details so we signed up and attended one of the night orientation dates. The address was easy to find however there was no sign outside saying ""LA transformation academy or fit and fun fitness transformation academy, or whatever it is called. Once inside the gym looked pretty nice, just one huge room on the 2nd floor with superheroes printed on the walls. We liked the vibe, and the workout music but once we heard the details we were disappointed to hear about the $497 deposit that is not guaranteed you will get back. There is criteria to be met including going 42 days without alcohol, checking in on Facebook 5x a week, and you must lose 20lbs in order for your deposit to be refunded. Some people just walked out while others filled the paperwork ( you MUST give your bank card info and have paid the $497 before the 1st day of the challenge). We told Irma we did not have the $497, we believed it was a TRULY FREE program but of course there is always a catch. She did not seem so nice when she knew we could not deposit that much and instead said ""oh maybe you can sign up for the challenge a month ahead instead just fill in the paperwork and we won't charge your card until then it'll save you a trip"". Of course now I knew what people meant about her being money hungry. The right thing to have done is for her to talk to us on the side and perhaps discuss our financial situation or what else we could do. This program is biased and unfair to those who are really committed, willing to learn and get pushed in the right direction , but do NOT have $500 to be throwing at Irma's bank account. Wish she would've stated that before and saved us from the trip, time, effort and excitement for nothing. She is bad at replying and getting back to you on Facebook. The fact that she hides requiring the $497 deposit makes me feel like there is something weird going on, fraud, or another catch we are not aware of.",ZAn6gJRMwjpRqmH3Ilz9Ww,Heidi R.,90034

My fiancÃ© and I were having trouble coming to an agreement on what our song should be; so during our first lesson, we presented Kristina with our four final selections and began narrowing it down by the types of dance associated with each song, along with our comfort level. We were able to quickly narrow it down to our final choice within a mere ten minutes. She made it so easy! Kristina was incredibly patient despite us repeatedly making the same mistakes throughout each lesson. She never expressed any negative judgment or frustration when we didn't put her suggestions into practice. We're truly creatures of habit who have a hard time breaking away from bad habits. She would tailor her explanation each time so that it would be easily understandable. Her calm disposition often helped relieve a lot of the stress and pressure associated with dancing (for those of us who are incredibly unseasoned.)Nonetheless, when we rewatch our videos (we had recorded each lesson on our respective phones), we see the tremendous improvement thanks to Kristina's guidance.

He saw me struggling in the gym and came over one day and we started talking about lifting. I explained to him that I am mainly into boxing but that I needed to become stronger to really hold my own while sparring. The next week we began working together and it has been fantastic ever since. Russ made my form the most important aspect of my training initially and because of this, I am super confident in my ability to squat, bench, deadlift and overhead press without killing myself. He has me on a very simple, but very effective strength program which has helped increased all four of the main lifts. It is also important to explain that he was able to develop a strength training program that didn't interfere with the boxing training I had going on simultaneously. Most of the time, training a sport that has a serious cardiovascular and endurance component to it all while training for strength is problematic. However, in this case, it's worked out extremely well. On top of all of this, Russ is a great guy. No nonsense, no B.S. I like to train when I'm in the gym, not talk and socialize and when we happen to be at the gym together, he totally respects that. So many trainers take up you're training time talking about themselves and about what they are doing as if they are on a sitcom or doing a standup routine. Not here.

I got started with no experience or education in working out, I felt so lucky that I could have him as my personal trainer at the beginning. He is very experienced and considerate, he knows exactly what I want my body to be, and he tailors exercises for me every session. I really appreciated that he corrects every single detail of my form and explains to me how each muscle works, so that I feel confident when I do these exercises on my own. Some of his exercises seem to be ""fancy"" to me at the beginning, which I really like to do, because most of them involves the whole body, they are complex but greatly improve my whole body strength. I was so weak and skinny that I couldn't even lift my carryon up to the shelf of the airplane cabin, but after learning and practicing his exercises, I can easily do it after three months! I'm so happy that he helps me become stronger and healthier than before. He also has a great character. He's responsible, Â keeping his eyes on me all the time during Â the session (even when I'm not working out with him!), making sure I'm working out safely. Not to mention he's also a funny guy! He's always telling Â jokes to make my heavy workout lighthearted. Highly recommend Russ!

I think the workout is incredible and live it when my lower body really needs that extra kick in the ass. However this time was a different experience. I just got into my second trimester... this is one of first mornings I'm feeling good (no nausea, morning sickness, etc). I haven't been able to workout which killed me so I decided I'd head to The Bar Method in Studio City. I was so excited!

The metobolic boosters are amazing, it gives me additional energy and helps me take on the world! The office is so clean and inviting!

It took a while to find the right workout for me. Seriously, I am not a big fan of any kind of workout. But teachers here, especially Sean and Viviana have been great for me to strengthen my core and fix my bad posture like forward head posture including my neck and shoulder pain. Their 1 to 1 lesson starts with cardio exercise that gives a pleasant sweat and follows with customized pilates posture using reformer. This 50 minutes program is pretty intense, so you will walk away with lots of sweat feeling so energized in a way although your legs will be a bit shaky. The studio is very clean and teachers are super friendly. You can either do the single or duo. I do both, one with more intense, one with my friend that makes the session more fun. I tried group lessons first, but I was injured and hard to follow. I strongly recommend private lesson for Pilates, and you will know why at this studio and feel totally worth it!!

I believed that medicine and treatment could help my body relaxed and fixed, but it was still same in pain. I've heard from one of my friends that pilates is really helpful for the balance and fix of body, so I've tried it. At the first time, I could not satisfy with exercising, and felt 'why am I doing it now with expensive class fee?', but every concern has been solved after 3 months from starting pilates. Now, I have a straightened body and a tight core belly and back. Also, neck and shoulder are so relaxed and smoothed. If you have any kind of pain as me, I absolutely recommend pilates for 2 months at least.

Second, and the most important one, Igor teaches his students with patience and knowledge. I have a herniated disc and before trying the class (he offers free trial!) I talked to him about my issues, and he immediately propose to switch a few exercises for me, which he is been doing since my first class. And guess what?

I literally moved from Las Vegas to train with him at Mansion Fitness. No regrets! In my youth I was an athlete, so I expected Mansion Fitness to be like every other gym to which I have belonged. However, when I walked into Mansion Fitness my first thought was, ""Holy Smokes!"" The equipment is top notch, the wallpaper is the Haunted Mansion level of cool, and you can't beat the chandeliers. The seating area has super comfy wingback chairs in which I quite enjoy sitting before my sessions with Rodiney. During my sessions, I must say that the music selection is upbeat and fun. Many times while resting between weight circuits, Rodiney and I have danced around like a couple of chipmunks. The environment is conducive to such frivolity. Since clients here work with personal trainers it's not crowded or distracting and even when we need to wait for a machine because it's popular that day, there are plenty of more types to choose from which satisfy another part of my training. The machines are well-maintained and clean. The shower room is well-stocked and clean as are the bathrooms. The lockers are convenient and are located on both the top and bottom floors. The fact is, I come 3 hours one way on a bus and train to get to Mansion Fitness and so I bring a stuffed backpack of necessities; it easily fits in the lockers so that is a huge plus! Lastly, I have to say I walked in thinking that such a classy establishment would harbor elitist staff. I found this to not be the case. The front desk staff are quite friendly and cheery and I've chatted with a few in house trainers while waiting for Rodiney to finish with an early client and have found them to be equally friendly and easygoing. Overall my experience at Mansion Fitness has been very positive and I recommend them to anyone who wants to enjoy their time at the gym as I have thus far.",xussYYBykfHhpIdSBsGI_Q,Maureen J.,90069

It's not gimmicky or superficial. It is real fitness. I am a personal trainer in Los Angeles and I'm very picky about where I workout. There are not many group classes that check all of the boxes but Real Fitness does! Each workout has a full and proper warm up, designed specifically to prep your body for the workout that day. The workouts are a mixture of functional strength and purposeful conditioning. There is enough variety so that you never get bored, but enough consistency where you can see progress. Each workout has a perfect work to rest ratio, just enough rest so that you can recover between sets and give it your all at each station. These full body workouts are thoughtfully planned and hit all of the fundamental movements patterns in a balanced way - hinge, squat, push, pull, rotation, & anti-rotation. You get to work on power, strength, speed and stability. The workouts are challenging just as they are programmed but you can modify depending on your ability or how you are feeling that day. They help you modify to make it easier for beginners or on days when you're just not feeling your best AND they challenge you to take it up a notch for the more advanced athletes or on days that you are at your peak. There is always a cool down & stretching at the end of each class. You will always leave the workout feeling good. All of the coaches and clients that I've met are super nice and you can tell the culture is just a good group of genuine people. The coaches provide individual form corrections, as well as personalized encouragement & positive feedback. Train here if you want to get fit, have fun & feel good.",NOvnusjd7ZuLsKlEx1mN6Q,Amy P.,90293

I honestly love this friendly neighborhood gym and its culture. There are NO judgements at this place. All the trainers are supportive as they work with you. When I first started, I had no balance and strength whatsoever. I was intimidated by the group classes cause everyone looked like they knew what they were doing and couldn't understand any of the movements written on the board and verbally explained. Lucho and Peter have been so patient in working with me during small group classes. The more I came to class consistently, I've gained confidence in doing the exercises ""finessely."" Now, if I don't work out at least 4 times a week, I feel like a part of me is missing haha. I challenged myself to take the group classes that I thought were scary with Michael and Jesse; it's been a piece of cake hahaha. Classes (strength, boxing, barbell, and circuit burn) NEVER get boring, and all the classes get you sweating! They're always fun and challenging. They bump really good music while you workout and sometimse all you want to do is dance or go HAM cause it motivates you to keep going. Also, the members are friendly and pump you up during workouts.

It is a fantastic workout that combines cardio and whole-body strength training through a combination of kicks, escapes, and acrobatic-like movements (modified cartwheels, handstands). All of this is done to music, keeping the energy high. Typically, you train for the first part of class (practice movements), and then ""play capoeira"" for the last part (engage back and forth with a partner in kicks and escapes).",G-v1HMu9vN2VvHGZYHYbyA,Michelle P.,90018

I couldn't be more happy. And prof. Pezao is the reason why. I could go into all of his knowledge of the history, movement and music and name all the names of who's he's trained under, but I feel the need to talk about the person he is because you can love any sport or activity you do, but what makes it so much more than just a great workout is the person you are training under. This man is such a positive light, always encouraging us and pushing us, believing in us. Â Being 41, some of the movements are a little more difficult for me and I don't always understand. But Pezao is always so supportive, showing me other options that make it work and patiently answers my millions of questions. He's also helped me do movements I never thought possible, or ever had the courage to do. So don't be afraid to try a class if you are big, small, young or old, he works with you and your strengths and weaknesses. Don't get me wrong though, he works us pretty good. I'm usually soaking wet after a night of training and often times sore. Yet I happily return for more. There are many great capoeira teachers who are skilled in their craft, Pezao is definitely one of them, but he is a man of good character, someone who I respect, who also respects me. As a woman, that means a lot. He treats me as an equal. He's not a creep. Â (I'm sure women will understand what I'm saying haha.) he cares about his students as human beings, often times calling or texting to see how things are, just because. I could go on forever....if you want a great challenging workout and some good vibes, come to prof. Pezaos class. You won't regret it!",pUUYUFbTDv-f41qiKOFNpg,Pinky T.,90018

I trained with him for two months and the result was amazing. He's very goal oriented which is of great advantage if you are looking for a trainer. When I started training with Victor I was 153 lbs and for two months I was down to 138 lbs which of course I shed off body fats mostly. My goal was to loss weight on which I achieved and was very satisfied when I trained with Victor. If you want to become healthy and fit Victor is the one you need to get the body you want and I assure you, you'll be happy with the result just as I am.

I simply wanted to know why they don't send a bill before charging their yearly dues and why they don't send receipts. When I question the legality of this Mayra was quick to reply and attach my contract with a scripted passive aggressive email basically telling me tuff shit this is how we do it. Even though it doesn't matter if you signed a contract if it breaks the law it's not legit. So showing me a contract I signed doesn't actually prove that it's legal that they charge me without notifying. It could be legal but the contract does not prove it. Fine whatever moving on I ask her how do I start getting a bill and a receipt every month and suddenly she doesn't know how to answer her emails. ,Y36knTjZzqhW-grfGeyukA,Coco H.,90046

I tried this class initially using class pass, and I've made it a habit to come to this studio at least 2x a month (which is the max allotted by class pass). The only negative thing is that we have to rent an ANT+ monitor which is $3 bucks (a little pricey!!) and I tried to look online but it was still a little pricey (around 50 bucks for one). I've already went here about 5-6 times so I probably already spent like 20 bucks on renting the monitors haha.",1Auvpbcrrg0XCPAlKFS-zw,Isabel L.,91030

If you're looking for a fun and supportive environment to start achieving your fitness goals - look no further. I did the 6 week challenge with Ted and finally lost those pesky last 10 lbs from my first pregnancy (gulp-3 years ago). The diet during those 6 weeks is hard, but it's not meant to last forever, just think of it as a jumpstart towards a healthier lifestyle and exercise routine. The classes are 40 minutes with abs and stretching afterwards if you choose. I find that 3xs a week is all I need to stay fit and healthy (especially when eating healthy). And the classes are FUN and HARD. You are basically just competing with yourself which is awesome and everyone is at a different place fitness-wise, so I don't think anyone feels out of place.

After I moved to LA recently, my doctor recommended for this exotic exercise to relieve my shoulder and back pain. At first trying out pilates was rather intimidating with all the special equipment that looked to me more like torture devices. But Regina made it so easy and comfortable with her clear instructions and kind attitude so I finished my first lesson feeling rewarded and my bones and muscle reassembled. Only after one class, my wife was surprised to see my posture improved dramatically as I could walk with my back straight! The chronic pain I suffered is almost gone now that I can sleep better. I like her teaching style that is very professional, precise and patient, so it's easy to follow at my own pace. Regina is much more than a pilates instructor. I can tell in every class she genuinely cares about my health and well-being so she gives full attention to what I am going though both physically and emotionally. I would recommend Regina's class to especially people like me in their 60-70s who have not been physically active but want to try something new to stop getting too old before it's too late.

I love Emma's classes, as well as Ty's, although you really can't go wrong with any of the instructors! The studio and bathrooms are always clean and well kept. Parking is easy, with a structure below. Prices are reasonable. If you're up for a serious ab burner, try the core sculpt! My core has never been so strong.

She put together a program that both challenged me and is getting me my desired results while at the same time, allowing me to slowly transition into more intense training. My fear was that it would be too intense from the start and I would get frustrated early on in the program and get discouraged and want to quit. That never happened. The build up was gradual enough that I starting seeing the benefits of my work after a few weeks, while reaching small, but significant goals on the way. Â After the first year, I lost almost 60 lbs and am in the best shape I've been in the past 20 years. She challenges me every week while making the workouts fun and something I look forward to. It's not the same thing every session and I think that's the key. Together, we try and stay in tune with my body and decide what to focus on based on how my body is reacting to our previous workouts instead of sticking to a rigid schedule. I realize that at the end of the day, I'm the one putting in the hard work but I honestly believe I wouldn't have been able to do it without Laura guiding me. She's helped me change my life over the past two years and I'm grateful. I would recommend her to anyone that is serious about making a positive change in their life",61wCh-WEpTK5yleXNnfRMw,Henk D.,90036

Â She pays attention to each exercise I perform and corrects my form if I'm not doing it correctly, which is very important to me because I have several past injuries, and I don't want to re-injure myself doing something wrong. Â She's very personable and knowledgeable about nutrition as well. Â She has given me great advice about what I should and should not be eating to reach my weight loss goals and she can also help with meal planning needs. Â I've been training with her for a few of months now and have noticed that workouts are getting easier because I feel stronger physically as well as mentally ( I don't dread heading out to the gym anymore). Â It's tough working out after taking a long break, but Bonnie has made getting back into shape less stressful with her knowledge of my workout program geared towards my body type, goals and expectations. Â An hour goes by super quick and afterwards I feel a sense of accomplishment. Â I feel sore after every session, but it's a good sore. Â Since the coronavirus crisis, we have continued to work out on a ""virtual"" basis. Â It's so nice to be able to connect with someone, even if not in person, who is so positive and supportive of me and me achieving my fitness and weight loss goals.",CKVH1AqXBFM4okED1Dq-jQ,Joanna S.,90066

Everyone is super nice and the gym is great. The best bang for your buck no question. I saw someone said they only had one shower in the men's locker room but there are three now so keep in mind a lot of stuff has been updated since the older posts. And I concur with the other people who say this is a no frills gym but it's not a no frills gym in the sense that everyone in there is super intense and in crazy good shape (which is what I interpreted by the saying). If anything this is the gym where being a beginner you actually feel like no one is judging you because no one is. Can't say enough good things about this place.,ItY-l2_9_RDNPu4vo7CW8w,Nicolas T.,90026

"DC Fitness is an affordable local gym. Most of our members live within the local community and they chose our gym because of the convenience, and ease of access.

Thanks, DC Fitness Staff",626 Coronado Ter,4.5,"Gyms,Trainers",DC Fitness,20,5,Echo Park,11/17/2016,"A community gem. I've recently moved back into the area and have been looking for a good gym to join. Glad I stopped by DC Fitness before checking out the gyms in DTLA (LA Fitness, PF, 24 Hour, etc) as it has turned out to be perfect for my needs, with none of the downsides of a typical gym. I'm mainly at the gym to lift so I was looking for a squat rack and bench. Was very surprised to find both of those as well as deadlift stations in a community gym such as this! If you're looking to do cardio, they've got a dedicated cardio room and a small grass area for plyos, with a couple basketball courts upstairs. Staff members could not be friendlier (shout out to Mike) and are available for any questions you've got on specific exercises or for personal training (I believe they are all certified). The price is great. DC Fitness maintains community access to its facilities with a low membership cost of $25 a month with a one-time $15 initiation fee. Month-to-month, no forced year-long contracts like other gyms. While the price is reflected in its selection of older machines and equipment, they are all still serviceable and have done just fine for my workouts. Lots of free weights available, yoga mats, foam rollers, jump ropes, two punching bags, medicine balls, and more. The gym is clean and has had cleaning solution and paper towels stocked every time I've gone. There's one restroom and one shower for men, with the shower area first sectioned off with a large shower curtain (no door, so pull it over to indicate you're occupying the space), and the shower itself behind another curtain. Bring your own towel, soap, and sandals.",PQEjUFvFogNw3WpJo24ACg,Wayne W.,90026

I've gone to maybe 20 different gyms, classes, and various fitness studios throughout the past ten years. Some were ok, some I've liked, but this one I LOVE! The space is very bright and clean. The culture and workouts are very female friendly and they have a good, maybe 60/40 or even 50/50 mix of males and females, which is awesome. They offer easy and hard versions of all the workout movements and they already have weights from light to heavy set up for us at each station. I love how I don't have to plan my workout, they do it for me and I just get to follow along and I get to learn new movements everyday. You get to do many movements each workout as you move from station to station and they switch it up everyday, so it stays interesting and you get a good mix of cardio and weights. I get an amazing workout and leave sweaty every time. The coaches are all super friendly and very knowledgeable; they motivate us and they come around and correct our form if needed which is super valuable. They are all awesome and have great energy and sometimes even dance to the music, which is hard not to do because the music is sooo good! It's a fun friendly space where members will often high five and chat with each other afterwards, bonding about how hard it was. It's everything you could ever want in a local gym and more :) I highly highly recommend it!",NJrR237DrTCFrUDJINPAQw,Corria P.,90069

I've been to places where the trainers, although clearly in-shape, are more concerned with checking out the hotties or their Tinders (or Grind'rs) than they are with instructing the clients, like they're biding their time before the next audition for the new ""The Biggest Loser"" trainer. Not at Street Workout Academy. Nicolas is 100% engaged with the client from start to finish because he loves his work and genuinely wants to see his students excel.

Andrea corrected many of my poses and movements, whereas in other studios, that didn't happen so much.

This gym in particular was the best decision I made while living in California. It gave me the motivation I needed to work out all while also being a part of a community. The coaches went and still does go over and beyond to reassure you're getting most out of your membership. One big plus for me was that they definitely keep you accountable! For instance, one of the coaches when I first started would text me if I didn't show up on a day I usually come. They did not have to do that but that extra step made a huge difference in me, wanting to be consistent. After a year and half I'm the healthy I've been in awhile and I've maintained that weight loss. I lost in total 21 lbs and gained a lot of valuable foundation to maintain that weight loss. If anyone ever gets a chance to take a class with the head-coach Eric I would hands down recommend it.

They also really mix up the exercises so you never get bored. We also had a nutritionist come in, Annora, on Sundays to educate us on healthy eating habits. One of the things I like about learning from Annora was the mental aspect to eating healthy and being healthy about eating. Being part of this crossfit team has been a lot of fun because I made some friends and I pushed myself a lot during my workouts.

If you're coming in to train from out of town or just wanna drop in every now and then, you can talk to one of the trainers about it and they'll offer a different fee for you. Even if you do a trial for one day, they won't bug you with phone calls to try to pressure you to sign up like other gyms.

For example, it would be a great idea to have class memberships for just spin, or just yoga, etc. But you do get what you pay for and its great here. I had the opportunity to have Arthur as my cycling instructor and he was friendly, motivating and took the time to greet me. I go to sweat cycle in dtla and sometimes you run into those instructors who think they're too important to know they're students (but it is also a facility there). Take this spin class if you're looking to get a good sweat on.

Â  Keith helps me strengthen certain parts of my body first, the result is I am walking better than before and not in as much pain. Â This has only been 2 weeks, can't wait to see what next month brings. Â Parking is validated, a huge plus for me. Â  Thank you Keith, Kai, and Jesse.",mTWKLExeb3lNizEX0KKKdw,Queen O.,90404

My clothes barely fit me and I was wearing the same pair of jeans all week to work. I had gotten fed up with the situation I was in and didn't know how I was gonna get out. I looked at the journey ahead and dreaded it because I knew it would be a long one and I wasn't sure I had what it takes to see it through. One day I saw an ad about the 20lb challenge and I read into it and I found that for a small deposit I could enroll in a gym that would help me workout, give me a meal plan to follow, and meet some new people with the same goal as me. So I went for it, I didn't know exactly what I was getting into but I was willing to invest in myself and my health. I signed up, attended the seminar, and I purchased all the recommended tools I would need throughout my challenge. This included a digital kitchen scale for my food, a pack of 36 meal prep containers, and some calorie free seasonings and dressings. All on amazon. My experience thus far has been nothing short of incredible! In 6 weeks I lost a total of 30.9 pounds and i am tee rolling for the next challenge to lose an extra 20. Everyone at the camp east LA is a blessing! From the trainers who push me and motivate me, to the front desk staff and my fellow campers who all encourage and inspire me to keep coming back! It's gotten to the point where the camp is something that I look forward to doing in my day and I'm sticking to the meal plan and it's becoming a second nature. My suggestion to anyone who is already thinking about going the camp is to not hesitate! You will be in good hands and the process is 110% proven! Invest in your health!

Â I been meaning to write one for many months now but never really got to it until now. Â Let me just say prior to 168 I was part of many other gyms and groups. Â Everything from your traditional 24 kind of gyms, to other boot camps, and cross fits. Â Like most I always found myself signing up to places like these losing some weight and after few months boom it all comes back and I am worst when I first started. Â I joined 168 back in August after stepping on a scale and seeing that 240lb marker. Â For a 5'11 guy who was once on every basketball court playing with the best of them and touring for gigs in my DJ years this was a BIG wake up call. Â I knew had I not done anything about it asap I was going to be in much worse place. Â After some research and calling around I was lucky enough to run into 168. Â I signed up met with Chad and right off the back I knew this was going to be different then my other experiences. Â Not only was I signing up for work outs but I was also given a meal and nutrition plan to follow. Â No more okay what can I eat and what can't I eat questions. Â It was all black and white you eat it if it's on the list you don't touch it if it's not. Â That's how it all started for me from that first visit and meeting with Chad and still going strong today. Â Fast forward 6 months (took a month off for travel and holidays) I am now 186lbs and down 17% body fat !!!! I have now basically reached a weight that I was 10 years ago when I use to play basketball and when I use to feel good about myself. Â To say it was easy would be a lie. Â This is not easy trust me. Â You need dedication, disciple, motivation, and most important of all the right coaching staff and gym to put it all together. Â The staff is amazing everyone from Chad, to Ana, Dustin, and Sierra to ever single person who walks in and sweats with me. Â I dont even consider it a gym anymore honestly to me this is my 2nd family. Â Some may think I'm a crazy waking up 4 am to be at the gym 4:45 for my stretching but I actually look forward to my work out days. Â Long story short if you are really serious about losing weight and changing your life then come join us. Â I am living proof that 168 works and you can do this too!",drmH9MlZlD7a0BvL78SSjA,Hike D.,91214

Every instructor helps you modify if you are new or if you have any physical restrictions.

Â For example, my knees are arthritic and so bad i needed to have knee replacement surgery. Â Prior to surgery, she adapted my routine to strengthen the muscles around the knee so that five days after surgery, i was walking without assistance. Â My doctor couldn't believe it!

"Disco Gym is not your typical gym nor are we your typical personal training experience. I work directly with you to help achieve your fitness goals and needs. By providing a personal, hands on approach to training I am able to accurately assess your individual needs and effectively produce a unique program that will work for you.

The GYROTONICÂ® method is an original, and unique movement practice with roots in Yoga, Tai Chi, and dance. GYROTONICÂ® exercise sequences are composed of spiralling, circular movements, which flow together seamlessly in rhythmic repetitions with corresponding breath.",3315 Larissa Dr,5.0,"Yoga,Trainers,Tai Chi",Disco Gym,1,5,Silver Lake,12/26/2015,"Rebecca is absolutely incredible and a true gem! I'm soo lucky to have discovered her. I take private Gyrotonic sessions with her and the way she executes her instruction is truly an art. She is intuitive, very knowledgeable in a non pretentious way, and is sensitive to my individual needs. She has a vibrant, sweet and playful aura and makes me feel relaxed which is not an easy task. She has the natural ability to hone in on my strengths, and senses what I need by taking into consideration my previous injuries or areas I need to strengthen as well as simply noticing how I'm feeling in that moment/session and thus making that session just what I needed. She really takes in what you tell her you want to work on and tailors her sessions to that AND also integrates more challenging exercises as she observes your skill and strength develop. When I'm there in the day time we take advantage of the fresh air and do creative exercises she's developed Â outside Â which is awesome and makes for a magical and well rounded session. Always leave her sessions feeling better, more confident and looking forward to the next!",52-508MHxLXgPG0lKXkkqg,Ellen H.,90026

Her tenacity to teach and learn with her students of the process of decolonization of the mind and body is evident in her craft. She often rehearses with telling you the origin of the dance and movement making every dance intentional to its ancestral being. Her expertise of dancing Hula and Filipinx dances invigorates her craft as she has created a space where she can start every class with intentional medication guided with Hawaiian chanting and still represent her Filipinx roots by calling out to her family's origin. She is a patient choreographer and facilitator that is able to communicate how to improve your craft and also, ultimately wants you to improve not only your physical health, but especially your spiritual and mental health. She has advanced traditional movements and put her own twist. Toni has an impeccable resume of dance and even holds a Masters degree dedicated to her craft. You can assure that in any class she teaches will always be meaningful and a life changing experience that goes beyond-to just perform. Her heart is in respecting tradition and deviating from decolonization that awakens every chakra and leaves you in a good mind space following every class by ending with cool downs and meditation with intention. I highly recommend her to achieve your physical goals and her radiant smile and energy will keep you returning. ",oSC-sJJ-rakjd4Q4AqfjOQ,Kathleen Ann S.,90066

At first, it was a little scary to pick up those kettlebells and barbells and I was dying doing cardio :) But now I'm taking 3-4 classes a week (6-7 during a 8-week challenge) and my body loves it! I'lm very grateful to the coaches who explained, corrected and pushed. Charlie, Justin, Oscar, and Gabrielle are the best with no doubt.

I have never been a big fan of working out, but now I never want to miss one. I even schedule while I'm out of town, so that when I'm back, I get right back in the swing of it. To have a trainer that knows the human body and muscular structure so well, with exercise physiology and biomechanics, is a rare find. Van pays close attention to your ability and always knows what weight you're working with and capable of with every exercise. His knowledge of weight training and proper technique is important to him -- and me -- as my body sometimes looks for the easy way out, which could put stress on your joints and tendons. He loves what he does and I love the results. I no longer have French loaves for arms. They are toned with no wobbly stuff at the bottom (you know what I mean ladies). My bum is firm, and my legs are more shapely. I am stronger then I've ever been -- which is most important to me -- and we are working on strengthening my cardio (my biggest challenge). I cannot say enough great things about Van. There is no way I would push myself the way he does. When I think I can't do any more, he knows I can and guides me through. He is very motivating. It's not an easy workout, but it's always a good one and always different, which I love, because I get bored easily and so do your muscles. Â After, I'm rewarded with a cool eucalyptus towel. I call it my dessert. If you want a trainer who gets results and gives you his undivided and personalized attention...Van is your man. He's also a really cool guy. I cannot recommend him enough.",yjP1Emcna5R-tsTh9jk-3g,Tiffany P.,90048

Â The boutique, personalized atmosphere Ernesto has created with a great mix of equipment is fantastic, but more importantly, his commitment to form, technique, your goals and not letting you quit, quickly won me over.

Though obviously not the ideal situation, it was cool because I was able to sign up for her unlimited package and learn even more dance styles from her!

I was just trying to find a find to help me get fit and instead I ended up gaining strength, agility, and speed. Her workouts were always challenging but manageable. They always had levels of difficulty to really push you. I really appreciate her attention to form and ensuring that you were maximizing your effort and minimizing risk of injury. In addition to her expertise and experience, she has a great personality and dazzling smile to make you really feel invested in the workout because you had her as our coach. For the last 1 1/2 years I was amazed at myself for having expanded my fitness activities to pull ups, box jumps, kettle bells, etc. my fitness improved so much that I even started running 1/2 marathons because of the full body conditioning and cross training I was receiving.

It is really difficult to find someone who truly understands the body and can explain exactly how each work out effects your muscles.

To see how much a person sucks or doesn't suck. Especially if you are like me and loathe the very idea of working out. Luckily for you Betina does NOT suck. She is so great that I am still mourning you being able to work out with her and I no longer can. I worked out with Betina while she was in Chicago (personal training & classes) and trust me when I say you need to stop reading this and contact her to get started. No seriously why are you still reading?! Well... if you are still reading I will continue with my review of her skills. Betina was understanding of my injury and my hate of working out, yet did not let me use that as an excuse to take it easy. She pushed and encouraged me to believe I could do better and lift more. Even when I complained, and let me tell you I complained and gave looks that could kill, she always had a happy demeanor that did not come off as forced. I could tell she genuinely wanted to see me improve and do better. If you want to be pushed, challenged, encouraged, and see results now is when you should stop reading and contact her.

As mentioned in other reviews, the coaching and front desk staff are both inconsistent. The real reason this matters is that there are a few good classes and a lot of mediocre ones. The good classes get booked up literally weeks in advance. You can sign up for the waitlist, but who wants to wake up early or rush to a studio after work only to find they don't actually have a spot in class? It's really very frustrating to pay for a membership and still have so much trouble getting in to actually workout.

Another change that recently happen within the week is the volume of the music is now lower in the studio due to people who like on the adjacent building complaining about noise.

I first approached this gym after my brother's motorcycle accident in 2013 that left him in a medically induced coma for 2 months and in physical and cognitive rehab for a year. Little did I know, almost 2 years later, the owner Steve and trainer Bryan would be training my brother in the fight of his life! He is a Culver City Police officer, and to get his job back after this accident, he had to, at 40 years old, complete the identical physical agility test he took as a 21 year old rookie out of the academy. Â Steve worked with him for months in the gym and at the site of the test - fine tuning his workouts specifically to his needs, and showing moral support the entire time. Steve even visited the site of the test on his own on several occasions just to survey the equipment and make even more specific adjustments to my brother's training. Today it all paid off! With his Culver City Police brothers looking on, his trainers pushing him forward - he was able to pass that test today. It could not have been done without the commitment of Steve and his team. So congratulations to my brother and a huge thank you to all of you at A Tighter U. ",b4EwceyvqzimFuIA-UsgOQ,Van L.,90232

Hate is a strong word, so let's just say I strongly dislike running, especially on treadmills.

I'll never forget the fear of my first class, a burn elite class with Liam on Sunday morning. From all the intimidation I had heard, I've never been more terrified going into a workout in my life. Little did I know that from that one class it would turn into a lifestyle where there is nothing more I look forward to in the mornings than going to take a class @Burn60 Regardless if it's with Liam's physical and mental abuse on a Sunday, Monday, Wednesday or with Chris on Thursday or Kaseem on Friday's or even Nick on Saturdays and Maybe even Andrew or Emily if I decide to change it up to WeHo from Brentwood once in a while. There is no doubt I'm going to get a workout in where I am drenched in sweat from head to toe knowing there is nothing else I can possibly do to burn more calories (500-1000) in so little time (35,45,60 mins). Which is an important factor in everyone's busy lifestyle today specially considering how everyone always makes an excuse how they don't have time to workout. I personally wake up at 5am every morning for the 6am class and there is no better way to start my day. It gets my blood flowing and the serotonin in my body pumping and puts me in a mood to conquer the rest of my work day, giving me the jump start I need in the mornings to be fully alert, awake and ready to conquer whatever the day has to throw my way. However you look at it, Burn60 has being a life changing factor for me, not only changing the way I live but also keeping me in the healthiest best shape of my life considering the toxic lifestyle LA life throws at us we all need it.",_VFiV-yxSjpo3RSwgjCfeQ,Jonathan P.,90049

-New Guidelines-

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use. We will provide disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer to all members.",2306 Hyperion Ave,5.0,"Trainers,Boot Camps,Weight Loss,Centers",Velocity Boot Camp,35,5,Silver Lake,1/20/2020,"I was first introduced to Velocity Boot Camp in June, 2019 when I took a free one-week trial class. I had been looking for a gym to join, but wasn't sure ""boot camp"" was the right fit. I leaned more towards yoga and walking, but was open to something more rigorous that could provide resistance and strength training. Matt's class did not disappoint! I was sore for at least two weeks and cursed having to get up at 6:30am to get to the 7am class, but here I am - 7 months later - a devout fan & addict. I am healthier, stronger, and have more stamina. Those heavy, Costco-sized bags of dog food? No problem. I just toss 'em in my cart.

I was shocked & surprised by this as I have taken class here several times before and the class has started 10 min late. To be fair this policy is listed, but like many I have been coming here for years and don't know when this copy got listed or if I never read the fine print before... but I think 5 min strict policy in LA is really unreasonable. 10 min would make more sense. And add to the waiver that people should arrive prepared for class any injury outside of that they are not responsible for... because they say missing the warm up is the reason, but this warm up is not extensive. As a regular excerciser it does almost nothing for my body before this class other than light stretching and loosening of joints. Worse, when I tried to convey this feedback about 5 min not being enough leniency with traffic in LA (as kindly as possible) I was met with defensive explanation rather than acceptance of this feedback. Great customer service would have been to acknowledge my frustration, acknowledge noting my feedback and then explaining that it is studio policy and here is why... but I should have been made to feel like a valued client that was listened to and whose opinions were considered. Unfortunately, the opposite of that occurred and that really makes me question whether I want to continue here going forward",JDiXPf3PFXGuKJhugx5T5A,Allison L.,90069

Been teaching me about this fitness life since five years ago and recently She got me back on track with fitness in the third trimester of pregnancy, I was letting myself go and sedentary for the most part, gestational diabetes, bad diet and all that. I'm so glad I had those last few months training with Gia, doing workouts and cardio to get me moving, eating healthy. She was even there when I went in labor! Pretty epic! Now looking back I did it for me and my baby girl and I can't thank her enough. Cant wait to get cleared and start training again and Â proud of her for having a platform to help people during this pandemic! If she has openings I highly recommend you lock them in. Her virtual sessions are like having her there with you. She is good about correcting your form to make sure you don't get injured and you get the best workout so your time is well spent. Also I love that she puts a lot of emphasis on diet which is soooo important, will check in with what you're eating and drinking and I like how she explains what's happening in your body in a way that you can understand, she's a very good teacher. Gia is highly motivating and still approachable and not intimidating which is great for beginners and she is also tough and will push you, which is great for people that are athletic but just off track, and need coaching to help them level up. Im so grateful we met, Gia introduced me to a lifestyle of fitness and self care. I was athletic as a kid but as an adult I fell into crash dieting, didn't understand how things worked, always eating too little or too much and not truly taking care of myself so that I could feel good on the inside with some healthy goals in place. I like that Gia digs deep and focuses on the persons overall well being, mind, body and spirit and I'm positive that every person that has ever worked with her has felt an overall transformation. Having a trainer like her is so valuable and will add years to your life. Definitely worth the investment. She's the best at what she does and she makes it fun!!",ezeNR79AyHxrMRTW9UwG4g,Tiffany Y.,90266

After 2 elections/re-elections and 2 back to back campaigns, my health (physical and mental) and weight finally took the final beating. I had gained almost 20 pounds, I had severe back pain and had to stop running, and felt depressed, hopeless and lethargic. I blamed age, my lifestyle and stress for my ""inability"" to lose weight and eat healthy. Then I met Gia Fey. She had such an amazing spirit and energy and wasn't the typical ""fitness"" trainer one tends to encounter. She was about loving yourself first, educating yourself about nutrition and working out last (but hitting it hard when you do). I didn't know much about Gia or her approach to fitness but I knew her energy was infectious and she had a banging body, so I sent her an email that dripped in desperation and anxiety and I asked if she could help me. Not only did she say ""of course"" but she also said, your situation is not unique. She emphasized that I wasn't alone. We met and the transformation began. I've had my ups and downs. Being fit and healthy isn't just about being ""skinny"", it's also about your mind, body, and soul. I'll admit, this is probably much easier now since I don't have to keep a campaign lifestyle anymore, but I don't travel less, I don't spend less time focusing on helping others, and between all my ""jobs,"" I spend just as much time working as I did before. I'm almost where I want to be physically, but I'm already there mentally and emotionally and I have @bodybygia to thank.
