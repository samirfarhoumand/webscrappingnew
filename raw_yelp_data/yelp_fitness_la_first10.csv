I then asked if I could just arrive a few minutes late since I was right outside the parking garage, to which he emphatically replied, ""yes, you absolutely can!"" Such a simple gesture of making an exception to slight tardiness is so rare at most LA fitness studios that I've been to. Not only did I get to take the class I was so looking forward to (I only missed the warmup) and drove in terrible traffic from downtown to take, but he also spared me that $20+ late fee that ClassPass undoubtedly would have charged me.

I signed up for a free class that they were offering for elites and got admitted right away... I guess not many people were down to sweat. You guys missed out! Ricky Jaime got me going and kept me hyped, what a crazy intense class. So, I got in about 5 minutes late (traffic sucks when you're coming from the valley) and was greeted by BIG smiles behind the counter. I made a dumb joke about how I thought that this was a yoga class... um yeah, they assured me it was not. So I walk in and the workout has already started, pitch black room and all that is lit up is the lights inside the spinning water of the row machine... so I told myself ""get to rowing' girl!!"" And then I died. HA! I went crazy and all out for the entire 45 minutes, I was not prepared whatsoever. So, we would row, with as much speed as we could perpetuate, for a slow 15 second count, and then we'd hop off and do sets with the wall straps, stretch and stop to drink if needed, and then get back on that row machine! Towards the end of the session, we did push ups and crunches on the mats in place of the wall exercises... and then hopped back on that machine! I felt so good after, so good! Like, mostly dead, but good. I swear more than I have sweat from any other workout, ever. Ricky had the music pumping to the fast paced beat of the workout, everything was so loud and energetic, such a fun class.

Definitely a high recommendation and how can you not like a gym named Sirens and Titans? And lastly, I was the only athlete in class yesterday. Classes are never canceled and I had a private session.

(All About You!) is awesome! I hadn't worked out at all for the last 7 years and went to AAY to get back into the groove of working out. It's like going to middle school gym class (in terms of how fun and inviting it is) with a bunch of friends, coached by a personal trainer, with a brand new customized 50-minute workout each day. The hardest part is getting there. Once there, you get coached all the way through your session, complete with plenty of encouragement and camaraderie. The trainers, Narina and Elaine, are so supportive and customize workouts to every level of ability. I love working with professionals who are passionate about their work, and Nar and Elaine treat their work this way. They are totally committed to their members, and will work with you to meet your goals wherever you may be on your journey to better health. I am really non-athletic, and it's a big deal for me to feel comfortable in a gym setting where practically everyone else is stronger, faster, thinner, etc. Elaine and Nar constantly remind us that we know our own bodies best, and to do our best, but not to compare ourselves to others. The constant caring and encouragement is so awesome and motivating! It's not competitive, but I am always motivated to push a little harder. ",vcxMssY4WFlOjqPNz3oItg,Connie L.,90065

Seriously! I recently moved from San Diego to Koreatown and was searching for a Pilates studio so I could continue my work outs. After reviewing a plethora of studios that were either strictly personal sessions or just completely overpriced, I came across Club Pilates. (I was already familiar with the franchise as there are some in San Diego but none near where I lived.) I contacted the studio to inquire about the founder's rate discount that I had seen online that was available for the first 50 members. I spoke with Danielle who had, unfortunately, informed me that they had already reached capacity for the discount but I wasn't discouraged and still opted to book an intro class so I could learn more about the studio. Danielle called me a few days later to let me know that someone had dropped out of their founder's rate membership and offered me their spot. I was speechless! Not only did she go out of her way to think of me (a complete stranger) but I was now able to become a member of a studio near me at a discounted rate for life! Fast forward to now, I LOVE CLUB PILATES. They have a vast schedule with tons of options that accommodate any schedule. Their instructors are sweet but firm and make sure you are doing exercises correctly (shout out to Becky and Maddie). Plus, they're located adjacent to a Lassen's so if you're looking for an incentive to push yourself through a class, just focus on that amazing salad bar.

I discovered it through a groupon, and I am HOOKED. Igor gives the best workouts, and each time is different, you never get bored. I have seen a vast improvement in my fitness, health, strength, and also my mental attitude towards working out since starting. It definitely helps if you can swim, but I wouldn't let that deter you. If you're willing to push through, you will get better at it so fast. Igor always tailors the exercises to your level too, if needed. I don't even notice the early mornings anymore - it gives you so much energy and such a sense of accomplishment. I can't recommend this class highly enough - If you're even considering it, just DO it. I read these yelp reviews before I went, and was worried it would be too hard for me, but now I can't stop going. Also the other classmates are so lovely and great, and super supportive.

You learn three sets of exercises per group, and then you do them for one minute each. Once you are done with the first round, you move on to three new exercises in a different section of the gym. Again, you do each exercise for one minute each, three times through, and then you move on to the third round. Then class ends with everyone doing some ab work together on mats.

"HIIT House LA is a 50 minute HIIT (high intensity interval training) program.

Each class is separated into 3 circuits of 3 Exercises (performed for a minute each), that you will complete 3 times. Why repeat the same exercise 3 times?  It often takes a minute to truly master proper form.
We want you safe and working efficiently! So, first round of the circuit is all about getting the form down, second is about about getting stronger and the third time through is about crushing the exercises.

The routines are very similar to other reformer or lagree studios and so is the machine but for some reason I find the exercises so much doable here. Don't get me wrong, they're still incredibly challenging and I sweat buckets. I have vertigo which affects my balance and I'm just more comfortable on the machines here than at other studios. Whether ur new to reformer Pilates or a seasoned vet you can always modify the moves to ur comfort level while still getting ur booty kicked. I've taken classes with many of the instructors but I have to say I think Dylan is my favorite. He's such a sweetheart and has taken the time to give me really good advice about how modify moves to accommodate my issue while still being effective. My only complaint is their super strict cancellation policy (12 hours, no exception). I wish it was a little more lenient, like 8 hrs. Oh well. I usually walk to class cuz but it's street parking only so give urself some extra time if ur driving. Looking forward to getting stronger n more fit!",UrmRwOOOtLqqfchIdN9CEQ,Lark F.,90027

As a person who normally jumps into everything headfirst, without dipping my toes in the water, I can say with complete honesty I was incredibly nervous about coming into this gym. I've been wanting to study Muay Thai for several years now and always put it off, maybe I wasn't ready for the discipline but part of me knows that a great deal of it was because I was nervous about starting something new. After doing some research on gyms online and through yelp, F5 stood out. It is owned and operated by Roxy Vivien, a professional fighter for over ten years, alongside her tight-knit staff. Everyone is welcoming and couraging to newcomers (quick to remind me that everyone starts from the beginning). I also really applaud the fact that they have you take a one-on-one introductory before you start any of your classes. I put down that my focus was going to be on Muay Thai and strength. For my Muay Thai introduction, I was guided by Anthony who gave a great briefing and tutorial. His analogies truly helped with comprehension of theory so I could put it into practice--as a victim of overthinking, this really helped me break things down in my head (THANK YOU ANTHONY). For my strength introduction, Alex coached me through kettle-bell lifting technique. Despite my not having a natural flair and being completely out of my element, Alex's patience and skill helped me through an incredible work out focusing on proper form on the basics.

My husband found F5 for me. He said maybe I'd like boxing because I'm Filipino and one of the best boxers in the world, Manny Pacquiao is Filipino LOL! OK! Sounds legit. So here I am 3+ years later and have no plans of quitting. F5 is more than a gym. It's a community. I've made some very good friends in the gym which makes working out more fun!

I've taken a lot of group fitness classes and also private instruction with various trainers so I know what works for me and what doesn't. Kenneth absolutely hits all of my needs and then some! He pays close attention to technique. When you're boxing, there's so many things to keep in mind, so he makes sure to look out for everything so that you don't build bad habits and you start with a good foundation to become a solid boxer. He also customizes the workouts for you so that you not only focus on technique but also build up your conditioning to get your heart and body ready to take your technique into the ring. If you have specific boxing needs or things you want to fix, let him know and he will build a program that is exactly what you're looking for.

No I made a gold mine of 2018 that I was going to start branching out into LA and taking classes and rise nation was definitely on my to do list for that. I asked one of my childhood friends to join me which she did. We made an account online chose level one picked our stations and we were set. Parking was very very nice, very safe. Soon as we walked in they asked for names had just checked and filled out a form waited upstairs. Literally did not expect what I was expecting.

I felt like something was off and some of the hip exercises on the reformer felt impossible. Now I know it's because I injured my hip. I also had to take a lot of breaks during the reformer part of the class because I either felt like I was going to puke or because my muscles just wouldn't budge. It was a little fast paced for me but once my hip heals I would definitely try it again. And I'm used to cycling so I like that the Pasadena location has that as an option.

I came in for a first-timer single class which was broken down into the running portion and the reformer half. While I very much enjoyed the running portion, I felt like I couldn't be accommodated properly for the reformer part. I'm fit and obsessed with form when exercising, but I felt a bit left out during the reformer part. Oh, and I just didn't really enjoy working out on the machine.

Obviously everyone's legs are different, and my 5'4 self is going to have a different sprint speed than a 6'2 person, so we shouldn't all be running at same sprint speed. I also like that every time I go it is a different type of run, be it increasing inclines, decreasing inclines, increasing speed and vice versa. She tops the remaining half the class on the reformer, and after 30 minutes of running, you feel it in your core. Expect to shake in your first few classes.

First, this studio is most likely not the best place for an out of shape beginner to take pilates.  Pilates can be harmful if positioning isn't correct and although the instructors here offer alternate ways of doing exercises, the goal of this studio is to give you a good hard workout!  Which is great if you are in decent shape and know how to modify on your own.  Many of the instructors use a microphone, which goes through the speaker system and it sounds like ""wah, wah, wha"" if the music is up loud.  (I know that's a petty thing, but it drives me nuts).",dqLhJkeSbu5J1KHKyD-QZg,C O.,90036

I can't remember her name but she did look like a Korean model. Super outgoing and made the class memorable. I'd come back again. The routine wasn't impossible to learn in the time span.

Your outer world is a reflection of your inner world.

You are not your story - my philosophy is taking a step back, looking at the whole picture, taking responsibility of the things we CAN control, and letting go of the rest.

You are where you are for a reason. Let's learn the lessons we need to to learn from our pasts, identify exactly where we are in the Right Now, and become more self-aware in our intentional steps moving forward.

The way you can make an impact on the world around you is by becoming the truest version of yourself, one decision at a time.

The way you make better decisions is developing an ongoing ""toolbox"" you can pull from, and spending the time getting to know yourself.

The way you get to know yourself better is by approaching yourself, your relationships, and your life with innate curiosity, rather than judgement or ""knowing.""

The classes are amazing: maybe 20-30 people and the way it is set up is amazing. You flip between roughly a minute on a bike and a minute doing another exercise, back and forth for under an hour. And they have classes where you do 40 or 90 seconds on a bike. The instructors are phenomenal, as well as the employees at the desk. They genuinely seem interested in each client.
