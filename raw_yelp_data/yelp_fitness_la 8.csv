Fun, engaging and flexible. I had to book some activities for my students during a child care program for our school. The program was a little hectic and scheduling was complicated but Young Ninjas was so flexible with our needs. They came three separate days and each days schedule was different. We didn't know how many children would be in the program and the exact number of ages but Sensei Joe was so flexible and made it work. Some days he had two children and others he had 30. The children were all engaged, laughing and excited. He connects with the children so well and both Shaun and John (company admin) were professional and kind. I'm hoping my school hires them for future activities because they are so great for the students. Definitely a company I would highly recommend for child and families, parties, events etc!",Ev7UDqkhQI7VBByJ8mR3jg,Nicole Z.,90036

From a director's perspective, I've watched many of the sessions and Sensei Dominic is so amazing with the children. He has all of their undivided attention. The children are constantly laughing and learning new ninja moves. It's great exercise for them and they really work on their listening skills and work on following directions (in a fun way!)  I also hear the children talk to their parents about it later. Several children have even had Young Ninjas do their birthday parties and they only have wonderful things to say about it.

He is utterly taken with not only the fun and the practice of martial arts but with the instructors as well. He even says he wants to be a Sensei when he grows up now! At every session they have a wrist band or headband that they wear for the class and also take home (which he loves to wear nearly daily outside of class also). They also sign a ""ninja promise"" that all the kids sign and my son has them all taped to his wall next to his bed with pride. The program does a great job balancing the practical skills of the martial art with the teaching of discipline and focus. I have overheard my son even teaching other friends the proper stances as well as ...""the first and best way to scare away a bad guy is with a ""KIAI"" ""(which is a short burst of a yell used in martial arts.) We will be leaving the school to move up to Kindergarten next year and hope we can find a way to stay involved in Young Ninja's. I wish they had a brick and mortar place! Their program and has given my son such pride and focus and fostered a passion for martial arts for my son at such a young age.

If you are an experienced dancer you may feel as I did, that they really spread the pole tricks too thin, one per class. We learned the same routine in level one and two, no excuse for that in my book.  I know not everyone is a dancer and that's cool, just saying if you are, you might get way bored, especially in level two.  Also, I don't like receiving lap dances from everyone single person in the class, not cool.  If you are an advanced dancer you might want to go to a smaller studio because everything really could be taught in one or two sessions. Mastering will take longer, of course. If you just want a sexy workout, this is for you, if you want to learn how to do pole tricks without lap dances from sweaty females you might want a different studio.",ryZYa2v5Df0CTjUlqW-cnA,Fancy G.,90036

Even though it was my fault and mistake for being gone and missing so many classes, she went above and beyond to see what she could do for me. I am able to make up the classes I missed whenever it is convenient for me and continue on with the course where I left off. How many places would do that?!? Like seriously, I am so thrilled with how this whole situation played out! In what could have easily been a scenario where I am obligated to abide by the details in my contract, Racheli completely took care of me and made me feel like a human being and not just a source by which they could make more money. I am so grateful to S Factor for holding true to their claims of empowering and encouraging women.

The intro class is $40 and if you sign up for the 8 week session which is $440...the $40 is appled to the cost.  You pick the class time youw ant and go the same time each week...two hours/week for the full 8.  There was even a mother/daughter pair in my class so anyone goes...old, young, fat, thin...it's liberating.  You do floor work and pole work and it's a fantastic workout...ou use muscles you didn't know you had!!  And the best thing is...you get to come home and demonstrate what ya learned for your significant other...and believe me...they appreciate it!!!",Mh7oEIX2oHYAXm-HAxlfWw,Carrie C.,90036

I like the fact that if I need to miss a class, I can make it up at another location, although the next closest one to me is in Encino.   I'm now up to Level 2.  I'd love to make it to the top level just to see if I can actually do it!",GO9BhMI0Lk0Fkaw4OsaU1Q,Madeline M.,90036

I also would like to  note that my busiest days are Thursdays and Fridays because I have work and class all day on those two days so I would not have called on either days. Second that is the number that I contacted as well as billing. Again as stated previously I was told by one staff to speak with the director who would give me a call back but never did and then was referred by your staff upon calling again to billing which never got back to me. I was then reverted back to being told I need to speak with the director who then had the staff get back to me. I was also told by her staff that a confirmation of my membership cancellation would be emailed to me but I never got it. Thank you for the follow up, I am sorry that the story seems so confusing but it is unfortunate as the instructors and the class environment was great however it does still seem that your staff at the location were confused with their own company policies and protocol they are suppose to abide by possibly because of the recent changes that were mentioned during my initial introduction to the membership contract they wanted me to sign.",afZsDg1hGiUgnP6keINtaQ,Anastasia G.,90036

And with it'd renowned name and status I figured it was the best. Boy was I wrong. Unfortunately I didn't know any better until I had spent way too much money and time. As a former gymnast and dancer pole dancing came fairly easy to me, but S-factor forces you to move slowly and pay for every level even if you are more advanced. This company is extremely corporate and overpriced. Not knowing of any other pole studios at the time I stuck with it until level 5-7, when I started hearing about other studios and decided to venture off. What I learned is that S-factor doesn't even teach more advanced tricks. Basically at S-factor a $440 8 week program teaches you a about 4-5 tricks, other studios teach this within an hour. Furthermore, they make there money by sucking you into a 2 hour class thats mostly slow meditative stretching....if I wanted that I would be at yoga. The stretching is cool for a lil while...but it drags on way too long...",Yc4fGejf1cNGulCUCIGpYA,Mina M.,90036

We did some floor exercises that bring sexy into yoga while also putting your muscles to the test. And, we did a move on the pole that proved that there is more to pole dancing than it would seem. This stuff is truly an art that tests the strength of one's body from the core to the shin banging up against hard metal to the hands learning to grip and slip in a circular fashion at just the right speed.

First class is free so a nice option for checking it out first before paying. Unfortunately the class was run by someone very young (Emi?) and while she understood the moves the Flow class was at such a rapid pace it was difficult to get your body into the right places before moving to the next one. It probably didn't help she wasn't doing yoga herself but either walking around or hanging out in the back. Her pace was off and this tends to lead those taking the class to be put in situations where they aren't getting their body to work or putting at risk of injury. She did a ton of encouraging, which is nice, but very little to no adjustments or corrections for people. I don't think a class of 10-12 people, with a lot of younger people, where in the right form the whole time...in fact I watched some and it was shockingly bad.

Unfortunately, like some of the other comments, the sales people were not helpful and one was rude. The two sales guys didn't know much about merchandise and couldn't really assist. In fact I asked one to get me a different color of the leggings I was trying on and he told me they don't come in other colors. Well- they do and I had to show him where they were. The sales lady in the dressing room area never talked to me. She just stared at me and went back to folding clothes. I even said that the I need a different size and she just ignored me all together. I kept having to go back and forth between the dressing room and floor to get what I needed. Needless to say I left with nothing. Very different experience from New York where the sales person listened to what I needed, made suggestions, and kept bringing things to me she thought I would like.

But while Nicole was wonderful in helping me through this transition, she helped me in an even more important way by setting me down a path towards towards becoming a happier, life-loving person. Our conversations brought forth the fact that in order to transition to a career and life that made me happier than my previous job, I needed to practice self-love, something that I realized I hadn't been doing. Nicole encouraged me to think deeply within myself in ways that I never had before to find the things that were causing this, which was my perfectionism and some self-esteem issues caused by past experiences. Nicole gave me wise strategies for dealing with these fears that I can use long-term and left me with an upllifted mindset that I know I will carry with me in the future. No matter the circumstances, every conversation with Nicole left me feeling positive and uplifted, and this feeling grew stronger and stronger as our sessions progressed. Thank you so much Nicole!!",NbBr4DGFGsoFOf8hyBMqVg,Sarah D.,90035

It was fun, easy, and they taught us so well that everyone said we looked really great. I was even able to keep up with my new father-in-law's wonderful dancing thanks to our lessons! They put us at ease and made the whole thing seem effortless. And we have continued to use our slick moves at other festive events we've attended since the wedding. Krista and Kelvin are superb professionals with a great attitude and an excellent teaching style. Pro Tip: Practice makes perfect, guys! The more we practiced, the more comfortable we got, and in the end, it was well worth the money for these lessons, without question! Pro Tip 2: Bring a bottle of wine to relax and loosen up, and Pro Tip 3: Definitely give ""the dip"" a go. I thought it would be impossible but it worked and we looked very dramatic!

We are a mix of different cultures & backgrounds and so was our wedding party. We knew we wanted something traditional, but only to start off. Our goal was to surprise everyone with a dance that was representing us for who we are with all our facets. We researched dance studios online, but most of the studios seamed too stiff or conservative for our taste. We almost gave up the search, but found Your Night Choreo by accident. Krista and Kelvin's easy-going and open-minded charm was not just a web-page advertisement gimmick. We scheduled a consultation and boom: Our decision was made. It was the perfect fit. We were so excited we had found teachers that were just as excited and open minded about our surprise first dance as we were and so began the work on our carefully selected mash-up dance to 4 different songs crossing over 4 different styles and eras. Oh and we are no dance pros. We are just a fun & active couple. No prior experience. Krista and Kelvin explained the steps, transitions and moves so well to us it was easy and fun. Granted we had to practice at home, but it actually allowed us to have some real fun during the otherwise rather busy wedding planning period. We were laughing with Krista and Kelvin and alone at home watching the video recordings they send us to support our practice. Music mesh up and editing was also done by the two. Amazing. Our dance was a complete success and we laughed the entire time. Nobody saw the transitions coming and we got endless compliments from our guests. We highly recommend trusting these two wonderful dance instructors and human beings.

We booked a ""one and done"" session a few weeks before our wedding, hoping to add a few moves to our repertoire so we didn't look like we had no idea what to do when the music came on :) We had researched some other dance studios but really did not want to go to some stuffy place or have to commit to several classes. Krista and Kelvin's offering was unique in that you could go for one 90 minute session and walk away with some new moves and a general outline of your dance. We are both beginner dancers and K&K did an amazing job of teaching us simple moves that only looked complicated. They dance alongside you during the class which really helps you pick up the moves quickly as you can see exactly what it is supposed to look like. They were patient and always willing to show us the moves again and again until we got it. Not to mention they were fun to be around and created a super relaxed, comfortable environment. We left with a video recording of the routine we had learned which was immensely helpful! We watched it in the weeks leading up to our wedding so we had something to practice with. We ended up SO happy with what we did for our first dance. The moves were effortless, did not look staged, and guests were impressed. Thank you so much Krista and Kelvin!",qMNbJqK54lr73zYjWwQZIw,Rachel L.,90036

We did a lot of research into dance schools, and decided on ""Your Night Choreo"" because we liked the husband/wife team. Not only were they very responsive via email, but they came prepared with a full choreography to teach us for every lesson. We sent them a few sample videos of how we envision our dance to look like, and we ended up with a beautiful choreography that was easy to follow, remember, and hope to dance to on our 50th wedding anniversary! As a bonus, we liked how Krista and Kelvin taught us basic steps, so we're able to apply what we've learned to other songs/dances. ",z78Kcr9PhgcnswpW9mjrGA,Janice R.,90036

Their amazing help and choreography made our first dance not only possible, but an absolute blast and a huge crowd hit! It went off perfectly, and most importantly, we had so much fun! Learning the dance was actually one of our very favorite parts of the whole wedding planning process.

I was in the middle of a weird medical mystery issue and one recommended strategy from my Dr. was to lose weight, and a lot of it. I'd been on diets and at various times in my life been more fit than others, but I'd also had a not-great experience with a boot camp and was really, really wary of personal trainers. Joe (and now Christa) have not only helped me lose a significant amount of weight, to my doc's surprise and delight, but also legit changed the way I think about fitness and exercise (and now it turns out I really like it?!?). I love working out outside with someone who's focused on specific strategies for my body and needs, and they've been incredibly accommodating to a busy work schedule that can sometimes require last-minute changes or travel. There's enough variety to always keep things interesting but I never feel like they're going to push me beyond what I can safely do or would get freaked out by. Plus they are totally unfazed by my constant sarcasm and they're great at sending regular mid-week check-ins and encouragement. I recommend them constantly to friends and coworkers who keep getting frustrated or stuck with other approaches -- this is hands-down the best investment in myself and my own well-being I've ever made.",9yqEA2EEr6njCWs2HNWmOQ,shana k.,90210

When I said I just wanted to use my last tan and was fine, they would NOT let up and gave me all these reasons why I should pay more money and upgrade to a membership, etc... It was extremely uncomfortable that I had to sit there and ARGUE with them about using something they already SOLD me! This place is worst than a used car dealership.

However this place, from the girls at the front being super nice and cute and the abundance of  bed options and availability and lotions galore, and I even found my now favorite bikini at the studio city location as I was leaving I had to buy! I LOVE the bed I use there, it's the most powerful one with the bronzer that makes you look like you've been tanning for a month in one session and progressively gets darker even after I get home as long as I don't shower immediately. I had to get their unlimited monthly deal on that bed and as a model, it makes a world of difference in 12mins in that bed. I travel a lot and have also gone to the Encino location as well, which is also very nice. I am definitely hooked. I appreciate the free tans Nick! Oooooh and I forgot to mention that if you bring a friend you get a free tan as well, but i guess I never took advantage of this cuz of my monthly deals I was on.

Thank you yelpers for leading me to the goddess of all tanning salons. Before being directed to this supreme tanning salon I went to one in Woodland Hills to be airbrushed. I always had to make an appointment, then the appointment took forever, and the results were so so.That cost $50 each time. So, I decided I was tired of that and looked on yelp. I found Sunset Tan in Studio City. Caitlin, who is the owner was super nice over the phone. She told me the Mystic and airbrush prices. I was skeptical about the Mystic since I have been doing airbrush off and on for years. the last time I was in a Mystic was 7 years ago and it turned me orange. OMG not this mystic -THE COLOR HAS BEEN PERFECT every single time. You can chose what level color you want 1, 2, or 3 then if you want bronzer or clear. No, appointment needed, it takes about 30 seconds and it is only $30. The first time is buy one get one free. And, this month they have an amazing deal.",6uU7mTppLUA9kPEPKDiOBQ,L A.,91604

If you don't know what this fungal infection is, it's AWFUL!  ITS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS! I have had to wash all my clothes and change 2 to 3 times a day.  Change my sheets every day, Shower 2 and 3 times a day. Go to urgent care for a prescription to get rid of it. Pay for all sorts of creams and treatment oils.   Endure the itching and sleepless nights that it causes. That free tan cost me about 500$. It takes about 4 weeks to get rid of. They supposedly clean their tanning beds after each use.  It doesn't help if you just wipe it down.  You need to spray something that kills bacteria and fungus.. Apparently, tanning beds are the easiest way to spread fungus..it's an incubator for it. I will never step foot in this place again, nor any tanning bed for that matter.",a0gHSG6i5j-6xa3ej0IoGQ,Marina G.,91604

Their front desk staff is always so nice and friendly, and they gave me a great deal on some tanning lotion that smells and works great. There's a variety of beds, and they have a red light bed that I think works for anti-aging, as well as airbrush and mystic tanning. If you have a package you can add on a mystic for only $10 when you do a bed tan. I have done this multiple times and have been happy with the results. ",qvoAhuHxwTRKlk6GmZo6KA,Stephanie S.,91604

I've had a very tough time with it and am very skeptical when it comes to new doctors. When I went in to see Dr. Cobb I was experiencing limited mobility in my neck and it was affecting my ability to function on a daily basis. I was EXTREMELY impressed by the professionalism in the office and the care I received. He really took the time to discuss with me exactly what my problem is and ways I can take care of myself to prevent this from happening again. I've been seeing him for 3 months now and I have no neck pain. I'm very happy with the care I am receiving and recommend his services to anyone in need of a good chiropractor.

I asked her to check in on this and she informed me that they were not working but I should be able to still proceed. Not sure how I can proceed when I can't see anything in the room? It was also super filthy and not in great condition. I asked if I could get a refund so I can find another place with working lights. She said that due to the contract, there are no refunds even though only a few minutes passed by. Customer service was not helpful and didn't even address the issue but offered another tan.

When I first moved to the Hollywood area about seven years ago, used to be called Hollywood Tans. It was a basic tanning place with beds, stand up booths, and they were on their way to getting spray tanning and may have already got it right before they closed. Since becoming ABT tanning, it is much cleaner, and much better service. It is not just that basic place you go to after the gym, it's actually an experience. Of course, what comes with that is a price hike. But in my opinion, the pricing of a good experience is worth it. One of my favorite things about this place, is the customer service. If you are following me and read my reviews, you will know that that makes a big difference for me. Part of my job title has customer service and I pride myself on always trying to help everybody and treating people fair and kindly. I really respect The same treatment when I am a customer. Tim, who I assume is a manager there helped my fiancé and I when we spray tanned about two weeks ago. He was so kind, informative, was telling us jokes, and made the entire experience worthwhile. We are excited to return next week. If you're looking for a spray tan, and don't mind paying a little bit extra for a good experience I highly recommend this place.

My husband has been practicing Jeet Kune Do with Sifu Eric Since August 2014. In the last five months I have watched a transformation in my husband that I had not seen in our twelve years together. In the past we have taken Krav Maga and Ninjitsu together, and my husband has always been drawn to martial arts. However, none of them created as much change in his personality and his physical well being as learning with Sifu Eric.  It has strengthened his will power, his perseverance, his endurance and his overall physical strength. Sifu Eric is a Sifu in the most elemental sense in that he teaches you how to direct your potential energy into a proactive and positive direction. All of us have potential energy every day which gets wasted or misused. The way Sifu Eric transforms my husband's energy during his class is amazing. Our work lives can be quite stressful and sometimes anxiety and stress can really harm your health, self-worth and general well being. When he comes back from class its like that is ALL ERASED. Class is in the park, which is fantastic, because we all don't spend enough time outside. Sifu Eric has changed my husband's life in such a positive way, and for that I am incredibly grateful.

It wasn't until the first lesson however, that I realized the importance of having a great teacher help interpret the high skill-level involved with learning and training Jeet Kune Do.  Over the following months, Sifu Eric demonstrated that he had indeed mastered these skills, and was willing to teach me the best way possible. Although his approach of integrating history and philosophy to a curriculum that builds strong technique and stresses ""real world"" application are enough to keep every lesson a refreshingly inspiring experience, his compassion, understanding of others and individual attention to students is what sets him apart from all other instructors. Even though I did not have the chance to meet Sigung Jerry before he passed, I am certain that he and Sijo Bruce are smiling down on those of us who strive to become the next wave of ""Keepers of the Flame."" For over two years I have been fortunate to train with Sifu Eric and I am grateful for every last second.

I cannot express how grateful I am to have found his noble teaching right in downtown L.A. Sifu Eric not only holds direct lineage to Bruce Lee's JKD but he is a breed apart in being  genuine, modest, and for a white boy he sure does generate incredible speed and the power which I too hope to achieve one day. One thing I quickly learned is that JKD is about precision movements and direct motion. It isn't only about brute force of kicking and punching but the ""economy of motion"". It is based on philosophies - Bruce Lee's legendary philosophies passed direct from the lineage holder. I feel that JKD is very much the martial art for a thinking individual. Learning Bruce Lee's philosophies and the authentic ways of Jeet Kune Do, the mental discipline, the physical training, it is my honor to recommend Sifu Eric.",JFrhCejVI42K_gV3scClHw,Isla S.,90019

I consider myself to be a tanning guru, I worked in the industry for 5 years and have been a member at several salons so I knew exactly what I was looking for. When I walked in the salon I thought it was very clean and seemed really fun. The young lady working there (Tammy) was alone and was a little busy but she handled herself well and didn't make me feel rushed at all. She took the time to explain the deals and was really friendly. I always get nervous going to places like this because I know they are going to try to up sell me or try to talk me into buying stuff I don't really want but Tammy didn't do any of that. She was really easy to talk to and made me feel really welcome. When I got in the tanning room, everything was really clean and the bed was amazing. I immediately saw color and the next day I wasn't burnt. I think I made the right choice with this salon and am looking forward to my next tanning session.

They charged me all of these other hidden fee's once I came in including a pro rated amount for the end of the month, instead of using it from the date I came in to one calendar month later, they always start on the 3rd of the month, so they charged me additionally.   I only wanted a one month trial and I found out after my month that they tried to lock me into a contract with them. I was being charged continuously on my debit card after the one month. I wrote them several e-mails as instructed by the manager and no answer or reply after three months. They froze my account through their system and I finally called my Bank and put a block on them, and I will NEVER return back to their salon. Save your money, and DO NOT go here.

Everything before I entered the room went well . I did think that 60.00 for a single visit was a bit over priced but I was open to it and hoping I saw a little glow . When I entered the bed I first couldn't find any goggles and the girl out front seemed busy when I came back out , so I just went with out them . The thing that bothered me is that the entire left panel had a huge crack in (my skin got lightly cut) . With that crack the light fluttered the entire time . It was really by no means a 60.00 bed quality . I have tanned all over California and never saw a bed in such bad shape and paid over 50.00. After leaving I stopped to ask for the restroom to clean up the blood from my cut and the front desk girl seemed super annoyed , again the same behavior when I exited . I would go back and ask for my 60.00 back I never felt more uncomfortable in a tanning salon. Maybe there spray tans are better but for the general safety please fix your beds with cracks - they are ridiculous. And also make the goggles more visible ( I found them on the way out at the bottom of a silver bucket ) .",vIpjq29D9CNMRZF1EjCUPw,Stephanie R.,90035

They also do not even allow you to get a level one...in order to do that you have to pay more for 'custom'. As soon as you walk in they are already trying to upsell you on everything from custom airbrushes, 'unlimited' items, creams, sprays etc. Don't make me feel guilty for using what I paid for. And heaven forbid you go out of town but bought a package. They offer absolutely no lead way to redeem your package that you paid for, even if you are just one day beyond. I even referred multiple people to them who paid the full price.  ever again. STAY AWAY. Not good customer service.

I called back and asked what should I do to remove it from the palm of my hands and feet and they said white vinegar / sea salt.

As a fitness model, having a go-to tanning salon is a must. After trying various tanning salons over the past few years, I discovered this place about a year ago and have been coming back regularly ever since. Natalie, the airbrush technician, is an artist when it comes to blending the right color for our tan. During our session, she'll ask lots of questions in order to get the shade just right and is always willing to add extra layers if I decide to go darker. Most recently, I tanned there before Halloween (I dressed up as a shirtless Pharaoh) and received compliments on my tan all night! All in all, this place is fantastic when it comes to providing custom airbrush sessions and they do so at a super reasonable price. Tan on!",DESQaa_2POYUalrhtY7BZA,Chris G.,90035

There is no sufficient air to keep you from suffocating while in there. I could barely last the time period because it got unbearably hot in the tanning bed. Additionally the tanning beds, i tried two were both cracked! How is that even safe!?!? The place was also very dirty. Not sure they have anyone clean up because the few times I went there it was office. Seems to me this place needs a little renovation and they need to upgrade their tanning beds.

She seemed nice, but I think the tanning product they use is so cheap and low quality that results in a messy and uneven finish! She told me to dress after 2 seconds. I felt I was still wet! She sold 2 sessions to me up front! She's good at selling!!! Immediately, I regretted my decision to buy the second session upfront, but she denied to refund me! I left the salon with a messy tan! I called the day after, she assured me it would look better after one shower! Guess what it didn't! I had the tan all over the bottom of my feet too! I was so embarrassed!!! I couldn't even show up to my pool party! 10 days later, the tan started to come off and leave very bad batches of white spots on my body! I looked like I had a disease! I paid $79 to get a professional body scrub so it can help me not to look like a skin diseased person! I went to the salon complaining! Natalie was there but refused to come to the front to talk to me! As I was going to the back to get to my car, I saw Natalie talking to a guy who seemed to be the owner! I was talking to Natalie and explaining everything when he yelled at me saying he would refund me and he doesn't need my money! He was so rude! He talked to me in a descending tone ! I asked for a refund receipt! He refused to give it to me, and he said he would never want to see me in the salon again and I have nothing better to do than wanting my $55 back! I wrote an email to follow up! No response yet!!! This place needs to be shut down!!!! It wasn't my first time getting a spray tan! I got it years ago at a different tanning salon, and I loved it!

I let it sit for 7hrs(I went to sleep) and woke up, however I was not bronze at all, I was the same color. I went back today to see if  I can get it redone, I was willing to pay if they gave me a discount, however the girl told me no I can buy another package tho, I was told my skin was possibly dry..thing is I bought the  moisturizer prep.  Overall just  disappointed, considering I am a repeat client",qUaUl2oOjpiFG1z9cgTvHg,Steven R.,90035

She gave me a full tour without even asking for one and the salon is clean and well kept. I don't think the pricing is confusing as long as you passed 3rd grade reading (for all the people surprised by the excise tax which is clearly posted on the pricing info and p.s. the salon doesn't get to keep).

I have lost inches/weight/dress sizes, am stronger than ever, and actually enjoy the hour of exercising (I can't emphasize enough how much I dislike exercising). Here's what is awesome about Fit Happens bootcamp: (1) the classes are small enough that you get the attention you need without being in the spotlight, (2) everyone is at a different level of strength and endurance, but the exercises are modified to meet each of our needs, (3)  everyone has a good time - it's a serious workout, but there is also a lot of laughter and support, and (4) they provide babysitting for cheap ($5 per kid/per class). Going to bootcamp is an excellent option for anyone that is unmotivated to exercise alone and/or hates going to the gym, but really wants to get healthy and in shape.

This way I did not waste money. Also he treats his clients like old friends...never expected that from him. I would also commend Christina who is always nice, hard working and loves  her job.

I went online and checked reviews on this place, the ones I saw where discouraging, I am not one to form an opinion over someone else's experience therefore I decided to ignore all those negative reviews and call to make my appointment. The receptionist that took my call was very kind. First consultation is free for new patients in West Hills Office. They do not take insurance for consultations, they do however take insurance for some medication, therapy, and other weight loss methods they use. They are located in the West Hills Medical Plaza, in a decent looking office.  After I gave them all my info and medical history I was taken to be weighted by this sophisticated machine that does  Body Analysis and Body Fat Measurement, I was then guided to a consultation room. I was under the impression that I was going to meet with Doctor Randall Caldron or a license nutritionist, however I was not attended by either, instead I got some guy called Eddie (a very arrogant and aggressive type of sales person) whom is not a medical practitioner for what I was told. I was hesitant, however I decided to go ahead and listen the information. He started by informing me of how many years they've been in business and how many people they have helped, he said the  cost would be $600 to $800 per month,  and that they offered several types of weight loss plans that included, medication, therapy, and b12 shots, after all  that he started mumbling and jumping from one subject to another, leaving me very confused, I then had to interrupt him and tell him to cut to chase and just instruct me of the program options for me, he started telling me that he would put me on 2 types of medication and b12 shots ( he hadn't  even reviewed my chart to see that I had medical problems like high blood pressure and diabetes and was on meds for such problems) once he said that I was done!  How could someone that is not a licensed physician be giving recommendations like that, and how could the head Doctor (Randall Caldron) be allowing  this to happen. I then told him I was not interested in hearing anymore and thanked him for his time; he then tried to convince me to join by lowering the cost from $800 to $400 per month.... I turn around and walked out as fast as I could. I do not recommend this place, seems to me they dont listen or care about the patient, they care about the $$$. I signed up to my local weight watcher and have lost 25 pounds in 30 days and spend  less than 100 dollars per month on my program and gym.",uBfU8v-wcWuLaKl9JeAqxQ,Cookie G.,91307

The staff is amazing! The girls were super sweet and were with me every step of the way. I first met with The therapist and nutritionist and they were awesome! Dr. Shaye was my gastroenterologist and Dr. Basseri was my surgeon. These men are caring, professional and very helpful men. They weren't short or rude like doctors usually are. They always looked me in the eye and never gave me the run around. I had my surgery on Monday and Dr. Basseri was a sweetheart! He was very nice and was a total gentleman with my mom, best friend and my girlfriend who were all there to support me on that day. He asked them if they had any questions and personally went out to them when the surgery was over to let them know we were done. He even told them what to expect from my recovery the next couple of days. Kim (their nurse) called me in the afternoon to check up on me and Dr. Basseri called me personally at night. They have been checking up on me and have been addressing all my questions. I had the Lap Band done and they took care of everything with my insurance so I wouldn't have to worry. They updated me frequently on the status of my approval and once the insurance approved me, they gave me a call right away. Overall, this place is by far the best you can hope for.

My skin had cleared of acne and I was looking to get rid of some of the scars. To start off, I've had a couple laser treatments in the past, so my skin has experienced how painful these treatments can feel. After my face was spread with numbing cream, the laser session began. After a couple zaps to my cheek, I sensed something didn't feel right. I was experiencing excruciating pain (unlike anything I've had previously) and was flinching each time I got zapped. I informed them that it hurt too much. The dr said he would give me a little rest, but then the zapping continued. I could smell burning skin. I was lying there praying for the session to be over with, and by the time it ended, tears were welling up because of how much it hurt. By the next two days, my face was completely red, like I was a burn victim. I had developed painful bumpy cystic acne with white pustules all over my face. I was terrified that I could be scarred for life, and for the next couple weeks, I stayed home to hide my face. It took me about 8-12 months for my skin to recover completely from this mishap. My guess from all this was that the setting had been put too high on the laser and my face got too strong of a dose or that my skin type was not a suitable candidate for this type of laser and I should have been advised that during the consultation. When I informed the clinic of what happened and came in to show them the results, they recommended more laser sessions. Seriously? Not a chance! I will say that the dr is a nice person, however, I will not ever return.",cMlX782hHiiEWOaH33PCrA,Ann B.,90028

Though I was a professional dancer and used to be very active up until a few years ago, after starting grad school in architecture, my lifestyle, alignment, and habits all took a dive... Long story short, I ended up with a back injury which got worse and led to me having to have spine surgery. The injury obviously had prevented me from exercising, and I ended up gaining a lot of weight. Post surgery, I really needed a trainer who was well versed in all aspects of fitness, not just rehab, not just weight loss. I needed someone that was knowledgeable enough to help me achieve major weight loss while also knowing how to help me do it in a safe and injury-free way (which  is rarer than one may think in the world of personal trainers, they're usually one extreme or the other). Sam was the guy.... though I couldn't continue training because I'm not yet fully healed from surgery the way I need to be in order to train (this is not due to my workouts with Sam, this is due to me returning to my grueling school schedule two weeks post-op), for the time that I did train with him, he was amazingly understanding of my condition, yet he also pushed me enough to take me out of my comfort zone and keep me motivated!! That's exactly what you need with a trainer, someone that pushes you to your max potential, but is also sensitive and understands what you're going through so that you feel safe and comfortable with the person training you.

Now, put that statement in the context of coming from someone who is incredibly cynical and generally distains any self-help movement the world has to offer. It's shocking I even gave meditation a try, but did so after my husband signed us both up for a UCLA course on mindfulness. Heather Prete - a truly skilled and uplifting instructor - taught the course and also teaches at The Den. I personally love her Sunday morning course and plan to attend one of her retreats eventually. Angie Vroom is another AMAZING instructor and her classes have become a daily must for me to start off the day. She is bright, articulate, insightful, current and, above all, calming - her community of attendees are equally interesting and worth noting. I also highly recommend Hilary Jackendoff and Eben Oroz.

I started going to The Den because I was experiencing chronic migraines and I needed tools for coping with the stress of the pain, with special focus on helping my mental/emotional attitude while we solved the mystery. Meditation is known to balance out hormones, reduce stress, and increase health, so this seemed like the easiest positive action to take while my doctors and I were figuring out next steps. In the past six weeks, I have entered classes at the Den in pain, and left many times feeling pain reduction, or even that the migraine I'd entered with had left my body. It's a testament to the power of breath, and the body's ability to heal itself while engaging with meditation techniques. I especially benefit from the group energy we get when practicing together, so this place has really been a blessing for me. There are many instructors to choose from, and every single one has shown great empathy for what I was going through, and has helped me to adjust my practice, whether I felt a bad migraine (they helped me lie down), or just tension in my neck (also lying down). Teachers will also chat with you after class and help you process what you experienced in the room and offer advice for future practice. But mostly, they tell you that meditation is tough, and every time you do it, it will be different, so you're probably doing it right. The instructors - and my fellow meditators - offer me courage and fortification in my journey. Also, I love the staff - they are so fun and friendly. At the end of the day, I truly think this place will be what you make of it.",v4DM3-qAAjrgEEZxvE9d6w,Mel Z.,90036

I have to say that the front desk staff is AMAZING. Super cool and always willing to do what they can to help. Helpful but not pushy when it comes to selling.  The ambiance and energy is very calming and chill.  I have taken several workshops and there is always a lot of support between and amongst the instructor and students.   I feel that most of the workshops I have taken have been so powerful and let me tell you to have a two hour or longer workshop for $30 (included in membership or less if you pay for a package--these are optional in addition to the regular classes) is an unheard deal! Especially given the caliber of some of these instructors! Now I must give a personal testimonial to how powerful and effective the classes/workshops can be if you put in the energy and the work.  I recently took a Prayer 2.0 class at The Den with Ryan Weiss.  I did not know what to expect but I knew I needed to take it. Corrine went out of her way to book me into the class (love her) so I went.  Ryan..is nothing short of magic.  Such a powerful and enlightening 2 hour workshop (for a bargain $30) I did not want it to end.  I knew somehow an incredible shift had occurred. LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER I came across a lost message that lead to positive information regarding a trust that I am a part of.  There are no accidents and I know that there is no coincidence that I found this information after this class.  This really is a special place and yes I do believe we can create miracles big and small here.  GO!,lTueI17v8DOmjZ0txMNtrw,Kristi C.,90036

I was first  surprised she asked that we meet at Starbucks in Malibu, seemed very odd but we decided to do it. We paid an astronomical charge for a consultation in public at a coffee shop. Mela tries to show she understands the problems but reality is that she was  a very cookie cutter approach to Ayurvedic problems i.e. it is a set menu (much of it is already on the internet) of medicines which she prescribes with some changes depending on the illness. Mela also charged us for certain proprietary medication and added on cost of shipping. Mela insisted that we set up a follow up appointment within a week where she claimed that we would be given a meal chart, this is a rigid regimen for the child to stick with certain types of food only. What really upset my wife and I is not the fact that we ended up paying $300 for the first 2 appointments (the second one being a 30 minute phone call) but the complete lack of integrity and compassion of Mela towards a child's problems. We did try her diet regimen and all the medication for 3 weeks NOTHING CHANGED, even though Mela gave us a verbal assurance that we WILL see improvements in 2-3 weeks, we saw none.

It is the number one complaint I hear from others who attend yogaworks as well. The only reason I have stayed is because of specific Iyengar teachers. I find that the people who manage the front desk are very rude. I also take issue with the fact that they won't let you enter a class after 10 minutes of it's start time, when in fact the class starts 10 minutes after the scheduled time. In the larger classes, there can be anywhere from 40-80 people to get in a room and set-up with props. This means class definitely does not start at the exactly scheduled time. And in the case of Iyengar, there is an additional 10 minutes of an invocation process. So because of these aspects, class does not start at the scheduled time, and yet yogaworks offers no flexibility in changing the late rule to adjust to the fact that the class starts late. In the past there was a 20 minute late rule, which I believe accounted for the fact that classes didn't start on time. But they switched it to 10 minutes--and they did not notify their clients. They have no problem sending us constant emails soliciting more money from us, but they can't send a client-wide notification about late policies? I believe their late policy is on a little card mixed in with their merchandising, so if you're not shopping, you don't see it. After so many other stressful encounters here, I'm just done with how shitty they treat their customers.",27nF6vrsF8Pz1_yKun9gaw,D H.,90004

Aka myself a novice was made to feel like a fool. I wasn't even taking a class just dealing with the administrative staff in person. Going into this yoga studio to deal with some things with my account today disrupted my energy much worse than the traffic jams we all experience. The worst part about all this is...I convinced my friend to go to this yoga studio even though it's way further from her house because I felt like the energy here was so good. Clearly I was in a personal dilution. The energy at their other locations is amazing but until there's a major attitude adjustment and re-training in simple customer service for everyone that works in the front desk area.. so far I've Interacted with three people all incredibly rude on different days.

She even knew ahead of time both he and another girl were first-timers. This was supposed to be an intro class, mind you.

I went here with a pass from a Classpass promotion, as I am always interested in new yoga studios. I am not a yogi, far from it, but I do have some expectations when attending yoga. I took the 8pm level 1 class, and it was just okay. Nothing terrible about it, but nothing great either. Nothing in the class was challenging, but the instructor was sweet. I was slightly grossed out that all the yoga blocks were sweaty and damp from the previous class, but whatever. My real issue has very little to do with the studio and is more about a man in my class, that I assume is a regular. Sorry Yogaworks, he is really bringing down your establishment, and you should probably talk to him if is a regular. My first impression of this lad was as I was walking down Larchmont towards the studio. I saw a barefoot Zach Galifianakis Doppelgänger. Before he entered the studio he was talking to a couple chicks passing by and all I heard is ""I can't, otherwise I'll fart in yoga."" Great first impression, fingers crossed he's not in my class. (I get the pettiness on my part) So this barefoot guy with great pick up lines waltzes into the yoga studio. I thought the whole point of taking your shoes off before you go into yoga is not to track in germs from the street, but ole Zach, just walked down the street and brought everything from Larchmont with him. Lucky me, he ends up in my class. Throughout the class he continues to whisper to the instructor, causing her to giggle nervously. She tried to stay focused, but he kept making comments about ""kitties"" not sure if that was sexual, but the instructor tried to be polite. Maybe I am totally off base, but this guys seemed like a nuisance at best and a creep at the worst. Maybe no one else in class was bothered by him, but I was. That with the general just ""okayness"" of the class is why I will probably never take another class here. I have a studio that I love, so I should just stick to that one.",sIfo0w1Kgu4MfgovaKutQg,Tori T.,90004

The classpass app or something didn't work and instead of just letting it slide, they prompted her and were rude about her paying. Shouldn't the goal be to just let her enjoy the yoga class?

Both wonderful calming instructors and powerful classes for your mind, body and soul. I wasn't expecting a emotional release but words can definitely heal the heart and soul.

They take your cell phone (and charge it for you!) so you aren't distracted. They offer many different varieties of mediation, Qigong being my favorite so far but I've only just started my trial.

The interior was cozy and homey, decorated with an eclectic mix of moroccan & urban vibe but I find it too distracting.  They have this big Persian Rug in the middle of the room which, I know added to the ""motif"", but I was almost sure that was one of the reason I got to inhale irritants and made me cough up in the middle of the class when I have to breathe deeply as part of meditation.  The second thing that bothered me was after my first class:  I asked what the next schedule was or if they have a schedule that I can look at.  The girl at the front said they are paperless and that all schedules are available on line.  I was dumbfounded for a sec because I realized I surrendered my phone to them prior to taking the class and I was also trying to figure out how fast my phone can go to their site and look at the next class.  People go there for meditation, at least print a page of the schedule so it can be referenced quickly without having to open The Den App.  If they are paperless, they sure did not mind printing out signs and price tags all over their retail section. People really care less about buying t-shirts or mugs or trinkets, so I hope you take exception of the ""paperless"" thing and print out a schedule - that is why people go there for in the first place.",Fg2V9xiqMaBff9sYOQ6IUA,Lily A.,90036

I love All Out Effort. Sam and his crew probably won't get you a six pack, or train you to bench-press more than your buddies. There's a Gold's just down the street for that. Instead, All Out Effort gives everyone a personalized routine, but first looks at the bigger picture -- what do you eat, how do you sleep, do you drink enough water daily, are you stressed -- so that you see physical fitness as a part of overall well-being. Then, when it comes to physical training, AOE starts with basic mobility (a problem area for me) to get clients flexible before it's time for strength training. To be sure, I've seen some amazingly fit clients training there, but what matters to me is that after a few weeks I was able to walk and carry things much more effortlessly, because for years my muscles had been fighting their own stiffness without me knowing it.  I also had balance issues, so they focused on balance exercises -- embarrassing in front of others what with all the falling over, but over time I got better. The AOE staff are cheery and pleasant. No tough-talking jocks here. Sam in particular is an intellectual who can and will enthusiastically discuss any brainy topic while correcting your form. AOE's unique angle is not to browbeat you into shape, but to get YOU to understand why you need to do what you need to do.

I almost didn't sign up with him because his interviewing of me was so rigorous that I was afraid he was going to be one of those ""yell at you"" types of trainers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Sam is very much about showing you a path, and you deciding if you want to walk the path.He's supportive, and somewhat chill, but if it becomes clear you aren't interested in putting effort in, he'd rather refund your money and have you find a trainer that works better for you. Sam is paleo, but you don't have to be. Whatever you choose to follow will be respected so long as you are choosing what you do vs just ambling along eating junk food or jumping on a fad. My choosing to train with him was not so much about weight loss, but improving my mobility and strength. The workouts are not simply an hour, because your warm-up mobility exercises will take you at least 20-30 minutes before you begin the workout. There are three trainers in the operation: Sam, Michelle, and Cindy. Their styles are different, but you won't go wrong with any of them (Cindy is the toughest!).  After I moved away from LA, I tried a gym & trainer in my location that ""seemed"" like Sam's place -- seemed to have the same philosophy and the same type of exercises. But it was an awful fit for me. The key is not just the exercises you do, its finding the right kind of mentor -- and that's what they are. If you enjoy your exercise you'll stick with it. I enjoyed every session I had for the year+ before I moved away, and when I move back to LA I'll be back with them for sure.",SuDGY4b5v0muHPu5iriE0g,Snarky L.,90038

My colleague recommended me this place and I am soo pleased I tried it. I've been having back pains, sciatic nerve problem for awhile. My last visit to my medical Dr. was very disturbing, because he said that I am suffering from Fibromyalgia. He told me I have to take medication to take care of it. It was going to be my first medication that I was going to take regularly every day as long as I lived. I went to the pharmacist to pick up my medication, he started to explain to me. He said, ""when u take this medication, u r not allowed to drive, you will have a great appetite, and you will gain weight."" I was totally surprised. I work, that means I have to drive. I work with children, that means I have to be alert. I am already unhappy w/ my weight, how can I gain more weight??? I went home so sad and worried. I took one capsule and went to sleep. I really slept very well, but I wasn't happy, I don't like the idea of getting addicted to medication. That's when I started seeing Dr. Gloin. With his nice smile and encouraging conversations he welcomed me and introduced me to his team. I started seeing him, Soni, Leda and Charles. All of them helped me to trust my guts and stay away from medication. It's been almost one year I am seeing them, I feel soo good, now i am more motivated and revitalized. Now there is another Accupuncturist who I tried and i loved the result. My thanks to all. Even though I drive 1/2 h extra, it's surely worth it:)  I love this place:::))) I highly recommend it.",X-dgMuZ3VHIFEwj5mPyjqQ,Helen G.,90019

I've been a member for almost 6 years, and I've taken classes at a number of SoCal locations. Like anything, some classes and teachers are better than others, and most at Equinox are pretty good. But, this week I witnessed something truly abhorrent. The cycling room at the WeHo location has really poor air circulation. There are only a few small vents and they're all on one wall, and often the vents are closed. If you have a bike in front of the vents it's too cold. If you sit away, the heat is nearly unbearable. There are ceiling fans and those help a lot, but on this particular day they were not turned on. One morning this week, we had a sub named Joseph Seeman. I've taken his class before. He's pretty good technically, but he's got a super bad attitude. He's negative and condescending and unmotivating. But whatever, he was subbing. Anyhow, about 30 minutes into the class this woman asked if he could turn the fans on. He blatantly refused and said ""it's cool enough in here."" It really wasn't. I was super hot too and was also really surprised he'd be so rude about it. It's not that big of a deal to turn on the fans! Then, she turned to a guy sitting in front of a closed vent and asked if he could open it. He did willingly and she thanked him. From what I saw, she was polite and friendly...even gave the vent guy a thumbs up with a smile. Next thing we know...in THE MIDDLE OF THE CLASS..this teacher gets off his bike and stomps over to the vent, closes it and yells at this poor girl on his mic in front of the class! He says the room is not hot and the temperature is for the whole class, not her. What!? First of all, it was super hot and a lot of us were feeling it. Secondly, all she asked is for one small vent to be opened...not unreasonable. She wasn't disruptive and no one would have noticed she even asked if this dumb guy had just kept teaching instead of bullying her. She finally got up and left class early. A few of us felt really bad for her. It was pretty shocking and ridiculous this guy would get away with treating a member this way. Not sure if management knows about how messed up the air is in that room or about what happened, but this guy should definitely not get away with this. It was uncalled for and really inappropriate. I'll probably never take another cycling class there and just stick to other locations instead.",zz7R5_JYr6b15rYVZ1W9fg,PasadenaGal T.,90069

I've been to many gyms in many major cities. Equinox in West Hollywood is, by far, the BEST I've ever joined. You walk in and ate greeted by smiling, friendly young hipsters who always have something kind to say...and they mean it . I got an amazing, thorough tour from Julian who knew every inch of the place and answered all my questions without stopping to think. The locker rooms are pristine and have hardworking women always on the move to keep the floors dry and the space clean and user friendly. There's a steam room, showers stocked with kiehls products. There are ample lockers , toilets, and showers so you never have to wait. I was hesitant to join because joining a gym is a huge commitment but I was so well cared for by Andrew Aragon, the most professional and kind membership rep. He spent thirty minutes with me, going over all my concerns and needs. And he didn't push me to join, which is a HUGE credit to his character. I've tried many classes and they don't disappoint . I got my booty kicked by Grace in Rockin Models Workout. I've taken Pilates with Chris, who made sure that we all had good form. Traci Keen's spinning class was sensational; I hadn't spun in years do she took the time to adjust the bike for my safety and comfort . Regina's Barre Burn really burned, in the best way. Earth Bar cafe serves everything from smoothies to sushi, eucalyptus towels available for post workout cooling off, a yoga studio that's clean and quiet and far away from the sounds outside, a deck you can lay out on, and a killer spa.

I bought a Groupon for 8 classes and couldn't wait to get started, only to find out that the number of weekly beginners classes is extremely limited. Unless you can go to a 6:00 or 7:00 am or 7:30 or 9:30 pm class during the week, you are out of luck. There are NO classes during the day or on weekends. Since the class size is limited, every time I tried to sign up for one of the classes I was put on the waiting list, usually in 6th or 7th place, so needless to say, I only made it to one class, when Sue called to let me know a space had opened up. Sue told me to be there 15 minutes early so she could orient me and fit me with weights, but she arrived 15 minutes late herself. So I was at a huge disadvantage to begin with, floundering around in the water with no idea what to do. The class is held in a small pool, next to a large pool of classes where the coach is constantly yelling to the class and the sound echoes throughout the facility, making it almost impossible to hear Sue's instructions. I think the idea and concept behind this class is fantastic, but it needs to be held in a different facility, with more options for classes and a more conducive environment for this type of exercise. It just doesn't work. Incidentally, when I sent Sue an email expressing my disappointment and asking for a partial refund, she never bothered to reply.",2FxQBHD6KMMii52SBYXLPA,Jane H.,90036

I had no issue with the parking fee over 2 hours, it was only 50 cents, HOWEVER, this morning I stayed 2 hour and 45 minutes and it cost 75 CENTS x 30 days = $21.00 in a month or worserer:).

This is one of the older locations and it shows - the club and much of the equipment is a bit dated. This said, the gym has tons of cardio equipment, an ok weight room(s), and ALOT of great classes. The gym is very busy and can be quite the scene. The instructors are hit or miss and popular classes fill up quickly so you need to be on it to get a seat. I recommend reserving online as soon as a given class goes live. This is especially true for spinning classes. The gym has good parking in a nice subterranean structure. There's a makeshift car wash on the bottom level which is a great time save. I am a large person with a significant competitive sports background (college football, etc), I like to lift hard and heavy if for no other reason than to challenge myself. This is not the gym for that. This is more of a pretty boy gym. There are very few people at this gym who understand what intense weightlifting looks like except for one or two of the trainers. If you walk over to the deadlift platform (kudos for having one) and put 675 lbs on the bar and actually lift it for reps, you will get many strange looks...God help you if you make any noise when you set the weight down.

Their intake paperwork includes a litany of forms advising all of their additional charges for every service imaginable: $35 for a doctor's note, $15 for copies of medical files, etc. Warnings that if you're too late they will have to reschedule your appointment (and yet i was seen 45 mins late). I was visiting Maria Lopez for neck pain.  She was a very nice woman, but informed me every step of the way that this or that was not covered by insurance and so she could only do xyz unless I agreed to additional fees (eg. $45 extra for electrodes or ultrasound therapy).  Now my go-to chiropractor (who I only did not visit because he has been away on vacation for a few weeks) uses electrodes, cold laser therapy, thor's hammer, etc. depending on my needs and has never not once charged me something additional, and I have the exact same insurance coverage that I used during this visit, which is why everything she was saying struck me as odd.  As for the actual adjustments, she was very gentle, but to the point of being ineffective--she was only able to adjust one side of my neck (probably since my muscles were still tense from no massage or electrodes to relax them) and used a handheld activator to do the rest of my back, but it's touch was just too light.  If I wanted a manual adjustment, she advised that her colleague could do it, BUT she was out of my insurance network so I would have to pay ANOTHER CHARGE. I added a star for kind demeanor and giving me some stretching exercises to do at home, but I would definitely not visit again (nor would I recommend).  Too much money for very minor relief.",HCrAo2hq-5v2XSuZ7ibwbQ,trystan m.,90211

She seems to really get how to keep the pace of the lesson moving so my daughter stays interested, has fun trying new things, but also comes away with new skills that she feels good about.  She has ""props"" which add to the fun of the experience but all have a clear purpose.  I'm amazed at the clever ways Bebe teaches the strokes--so simple and kid-friendly (freestyle is scooping ice cream, breaststroke is making pizza)--but spot on with her technical knowledge.  I love knowing that my daughter is gaining confidence about her physical ability through learning the strokes.  However, more than anything, I love that she gets to experience swimming as something that is fun, largely because Bebe is fun, attentive, and caring and is setting a beautiful blueprint of how good learning a new sport and being with a coach can feel.",TM9OCNmZb2W_DBAru6E4xA,Cadence R.,90049

I'm talking about me being all the way to the right in the hallway to the locker room, and a guy twice my weight facing me, 12 inches away, shouting at me to move, and then laughing hysterically. I asked the guy himself to apologize. He refused. His manager said he needed several days to investigate (after which he never got back to me). Complained to district management as well, but to no avail. All I wanted was assurances that this guy wouldn't bully me like this anymore. Couldn't even get that much out of them.

He has completely changed my fitness level. I met Scott when he was at the Manhattan Beach 24 hour fitness on Rosecrans...and I followed him to the West Hollywood club. He saw me doing push ups, then gave me a free training session, and pointed out some issues. I was hooked, of course, but it was the best decision I have made in a lonnnngggg time. We have worked as a team on fitness, training, strength and form. I had a moutain bike accident in 2005 and had no clue how badly I had twisted my body until working with Scott. I had plataued in 2 years of exercise, and knew I needed to up it up a notch, but didn't know how. Now, after only 3 months with Scott, I have lost 12 pounds, 3 inches off my waist (4 dress sizes), and regained much of my balance and core strength. I have even started training for the LA Marathon 2014. I am looking so much better, and feeling so much healthier than before. Scott makes working out fun, and knows how to get results.

Today I was on the treadmill and when I got home I thought perhaps I had left my iPhone at the gym. I called up and spoke to both Olivia and Kristal who both told me that company policy prohibited them from giving out that information; I said I have to go to a memorial service in the Marina,is my phone there or not but they insisted I had to come by.Well,when I drove over I thought that this must be a good sign  because why would they ask me to come by if they didn't have my phone. I have left other things behind and when I called the front office they were very amenable in giving me this information, so feeling optimistic I drove over and Olivia behind the counter said, oh no,nothing has been turned into lost and found today.  What? You just couldn't tell me that on the phone? Is there something wrong with them? I felt like crying over their stupidity and unwillingness to help me out with the information. I wanted to say no wonder you're still folding towels if you can't think beyond the box and just tell me over the phone that you didn't have anything in lost and found. Very disappointed with this experience, but thankful that when I returned to my car and really gave it a look-see, I found the phone between the seats.  Please, they must come up with a better policy than the one they have or better yet, get some employees who really give a damn.",7Mq2eic9PxVje22UCQCNgg,Pat D.,90069

I know some people are only paying $10 for the 24 memberships, and even new members only pay about $45, but it's also the biggest gym in the US, so there is no excuse for incompetent managers (the manager that has been here for maybe 6 months directly correlates to a timeline of noticeable decline), dirty equipment/common areas (there are times when the dumbbells literally stink, and any bench or machine with a seat is always disgusting). I understand there is nothing management can do if you go to a piece of equipment after a sweating asshole doesn't wipe the seat, but the janitors never clean anything except bathrooms and floors. I have been going to this gym for a few years now, and the only reason I stay is that's it's walking distance from home.

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use.

It is a very diversified class and I  liked all the other campers, very positive and welcoming vibe from everyone. At the end of the class I was really happy I attended. For this particular class we did rotations in different corners of the room where we worked on different parts of our body.

On top of the workout you can get nutritional help via food logs (that doesn't even cost extra) and believe me when I tell you that IT WORKS!

-New Guidelines-

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase.

Cal, and the WeHo location is one of the worst.  I want to like it because it's so close by but I'm amazed that a large, high-profile gym could be managed so, so poorly - or not managed at all. 90% of the time, the front desk staff don't look at or speak to me when I come in. They're almost always busy talking to each other like they're out at a bar. They clearly think they're too cool to care about the reason they're actually there. Which they're not, btw. Not a cute guy among them. If they do bother to respond to a question, it's with reluctance and disinterest. Aside from being filthy, the cardio equipment (treadmills, elipticals, etc.) is ANCIENT and constantly broken. If you report it to the front-desk staff, they look at you like, ""why should I care?"" No joke. There's a cleaning ""crew"" of two people who are there in the morning, with their noxious, unhealthy chemicals but they do a superficial, surface job of cleaning the bottom of the equipment. I've noticed food wrappers and odd stains on the same equipment for several days at a time. Same thing for towels on the gym floor. The ""crew"" just ignores it all. It's idiotic that the cleaners walk around with a bucket of vaporous chemicals while people are working out. Hello, manager? This is counter-intuitive for a gym. To be honest, the men's locker room is kept remarkably clean, given how many people work out here but the bathroom sinks are DISGUSTING. And I mean DISGUSTING. If you get some water to trickle out of the faucet, you quickly notice that the sinks smell like actual toilets. I am not exaggerating. It's putrid. You couldn't pay me to venture into the showers. I can't imagine how awful they must be. Basically, this gym is just a basic, low-rent, ""we-only-want-your-money-and-couldn't-care-less-about-your-fitness"" gym. I'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this place if I were the manager and I'm amazed that someone from 24 Hour corporate hasn't stopped by this pit. If you have any other options than the WeHo 24 Hour, I'd go with that. Anything would be better.

So I acquired a 3 day guest pass online for this location due to it being close to my school and my classmate has a membership. She was trying to convince me to sign up so I came to check out this location. I checked in at the front desk where the employee called over Tas I believe his name was, whom had told me i can't work out at this location or use the guest pass because i don't live in West Hollywood. Then told me if I wanted to buy a day pass for 25$ which I told him No I just wanted to use the guest pass to see how I like the location. Tas went to get Vanessa P. whom in assuming was his Supervisor. She approached me as if she was going to help only to ask for my ID to see that I live in Valley Village to quickly say You can't work out here sorry. Then tried to signed me up and tell me just to get added to my classmates membership.

He refuses to allow my friend to tour the facility simply because she was unable to purchase a membership since there is no 24 hour fitness gym near her hometown.

The gym was always dirty, gross bathrooms, broken equipment, etc. but I figured the weights weigh the same at 24 as Equinox. I was getting what I paid for. The trouble came when I switched gyms and tried to cancel my membership. I called a number and was told I have to go in person, that it was the only way to cancel. So I finally have the opportunity to come in and cancel. I was told that the only person who could cancel my membership was the GM and that he was in a meeting. I left with his business card and wrote an email to cancel. After receiving no response, I called his extension and someone else picked up. When I told them what I was trying to do, I was told that he was as unavailable. Everything I tried, I felt like I was getting run in circles. Wasting my time until I would give up. I finally dig up my member agreement file, found my contract and sift through the fine print. In there was a 1800 number, which I called. After waiting on hold forever, I finally spoke with a rep that was clearly located in India. They kept trying to sell me a discounted membership or a freeze to me account. I said ""no, just cancel it."" They said they cancelled it, but my online account still says ""active"". I have a feeling this isn't over yet.

I'm not usually such a drama queen. Plus I noticed that the homelessness in the locker room seems solved, and they made some repairs in the showers. BUT, wow, I went in the pool for the first time in months about 4 weeks ago, after a few laps I stopped to talk to the guy in the next lane who was doing laps. He said ""hey man, I get a rash every time I swim here now, is there a lot of chlorine in this pool?"" -- I said ""it was a problem for a while last winter, but I think they have it....hmmm...under control...wow my eyes are burning...maybe not!"" I ended my swim. Did you change the chemical you're using? It's supposed to be a salt water pool requiring less chemicals, if any. That night I got a rash on my torso, textbook chemical sensitivity. But at least I can do abs, right? Wrong...there's some kind of bio hazard in the abs room, for weeks and weeks....an entire room closed off, looked like the last scene in E.T. when the government showed up. I find myself having to wait for the leg machines and some of the cable lifters--I always fight my way into the one overcrowded steam room which unfortunately has to service the entire club--money saving to only have one sauna and steam room, but hardly convenient considering I have to don a bathing suit to go into the sauna and steam room. And the coup-de-grace -- my first roach....men's locker room...I'm from NY and I'm used to roaches, but they're big out here in LA!...oh and the soap was out in the middle of the day more than once. The lockers are really beat up, clearly many of the brackets are bent and some hinges are really loose. These are things that they should not have to be told to fix. I do think they have maintained the cardio equipment and cycles very well, and this is certainly the cleanest of all the 24's in the area. I went to the one on Sunset yesterday, and you don't want to know--there was a wall of toilet paper in both stalls, wet dirty towels all over the place, overflowing garbage cans--I took pictures, it looked like a war zone. The folks who work here in Weho are great, I like the clientele and it's pretty chill, and it's not a total dump like some have said.

Fitness '5' Stars and here's why. A little background on my experience with 24 Hrs. First, I have been a member since 2003; joining the one in Aliso Viejo, Ca. When I moved up here to W. Hollywood I started going to this one; working out with my son beginning in 2013. I really enjoyed working out there. The manager at the time was very nice and personable and the front desk crew, for the most part were hospitable enough. I took some time off from the gym...let's say quite a bit of time! LOL! But now in May of 2017 I am B.A.C.K! So here's is why I am giving this gym '5' Stars. My first day back I had trouble with checking in. Wes and Adrian were so helpful, accommodating and genuinely concerned as to why my number wasn't working. Wes could see I had been a member for quite sometime...albeit not so active recently, but that I had kept my membership current. He noted my record and let me work out that day. He and Adrian were so understanding. They said I should speak with the manager Vanessa on the following Monday. This all happened on Friday prior to that Monday. Adrian said if I had any questions regarding any of the equipment to just ask him and he would be more than happy to help me! Flash forward to me meeting Vanessa...the manager. She is truly a delightful person. At first I wasn't sure if I would take to any manager other than David, but she won me over! Also I am going to mention Sergio, because he was working with Vanessa to straighten out my dilemma! Everything got sorted and I am back on track...enjoying 'My' gym! Thanks to everyone I mentioned in this review! You guys and ladies R.O.C.K!!!!! ",0P9TKSxp0HCEd7nI_2zCug,Faith M.,90069

I've been checking out various Super Sports around the SoCal area, and this definitely does not compare to the one in Santa Monica (31st Street) or Yorba Linda/Ontario/Chino. For starters, it is extremely packed even at typical off hours. The layout is confusing - finding the machine you want to use could involve a lot of wandering. Finally you have to pay for parking, which is annoying since the rate will be jacked up since you wasted a lot of your time looking for a specific machine instead of working out. Therefore, definitely not one of my places to go. If you really must Super Sport, the one in Santa Monica offers free parking for 2 hours, and the one on the Promenade also allows for free parking if you park in the Promenade's parking structure.",Ank2QSp3x-r1bXJui2QDtQ,Alex C.,90069

For the best part of the year, barely a trickle of water came out of any of the faucets in the women's room. For at least 3 months, a hand dryer in the locker room has been out of order.

I'm beyond disappointed by this gym especially because this is listed as one of their super sport locations. First, I've given this gym a few tries because it is the closest one to where I live but it's been a waste of time and money each time. The classes here are mediocre and unsatisfying. Each time I've tried to take a class here, the sound system cuts out not once but multiple times each class and the music is barely audible when the instructors are able to get it to work because if they turn it up at all, that is another cause of the cut outs. Second, the instructors here are surprisingly amateur. It's very shocking to me because as far as I know, body pump is supposed to be the same format at all locations (and I know there are different releases) but I think I've taken it at this location about three times and the first two times, the instructors were extremely low energy and didn't seem to be following the format at all and today, not only was the instructor extremely low energy and unmotivating but she was also off tempo for every single track and every exercise that she did throughout the class. I have to admit, it was driving me so crazy that I had to leave about 15 minutes before the class had even ended and I left feeling like I didn't even work out at all because the exercises that she was having us do we're very lazy feeling and easy. It's extremely shocking to me because the instructors at the North Hollywood location are absolutely amazing so I guess I'll just stick to that location if I decide to keep my membership.",XfJrCROIcjF3bnmXoQP9Ww,Jillian P.,90069

All companies send payment receipts, gas, electric, DWP, car, health insurance, amazon, everything. I finally reached them to make sure it's officially canceled and I asked them how could they charge me without notifying me every month? The rep said he agreed with me that it's a problem but that 24 hour lets you OPT IN if you want to receive a receipt or not. I was never given that conscious choice and I would have never chosen not to receive a receipt. I reported this to my bank as fraud and they did an investigation, determined it is fraud and credited my account for the last 18 months, which is the most they are able to do at this first stage.

From the previous comments one would even wonder how the establishment not shut down by the public health department.  But I am really glad that I stopped by to check for myself.  When I walked in I was greeted by the friendly staff at the desk.  I asked for a tour of the facilities as I was concerned about some of the things I had read. Michael M. told me it would be no problem if I could wait 20 minutes or so since the staff member was at lunch, or that if I wanted I could just take a look around myself. He DID NOT say it would cost $25.00 or that I had to have a 3 day free pass. So I can debunk that personally. Off I went to view the gym, I looked at the equipment, I look at the floors I looked at the ceilings.  I went to the pool area, I went to the men's locker room. I did not go into the ladies locker room, so I can't speak on that. However,  it would be odd for one room to be clean and the other not. One major concern was all the post about Microbial hazards/ danger. I'm a vocalist, so I dang sure can't be breathing in all that crap. So that was a HUGE concern. Well, not a sign in sight.

Rony has amazing energy, radiates happiness and is well organized. I was nervous to attend the retreat solo, especially with limited yoga experience, but it was more fun and relaxing than I could have imagined. In one week I experienced everything from restorative candlelit yoga to 80's dance party yoga and everything in between. Our twice-daily flows focused on different chakras each day, and every session left me feeling both physically challenged and mentally centered. After Costa Rica I was able to join Rony's 1 day detox retreat in LA. It was another fantastic day filled with yoga, hiking, healthy and delicious food, and a powerful speaker. Rony's gorgeous retreat setting is gravy on top of the whole experience!",jP8xldTKomOximiAg_Bf-A,M Y.,90069

The pain became so bad that I was forced to leave my desk job and work from home when my body would allow. Many visits to physical therapists, massage therapists, chiropractors, acupuncturists, spine specialists, and neurologists provided little relief and no insight into how to solve the problem. Steriod injections and other expensive procedures were a big waste of money for me. After having given up and just dealing with the pain for the last year, I found Vivie through Yelp and decided to give her a try. Vivie focused on re-aligning my hips, which was something other specialists were not concerned with. After the first visit I had significant relief and for the first time in 3 years I went several days at a time without any pain. She also gave me exercises to help improve my posture and strengthen key areas. After 6 weeks with her I am about 85% better, but most importantly I feel like I know how to fix the problem.

I've had back issues for a long time and have been to numerous orthopedists, osteopaths, acupuncturists, chiropractors as well as physical therapy. I know something about pain. But after meeting Vivian I realized I know far less about wellness and how to prevent pain. I saw Viv for several adjustments as well as a one hour session and plan to have more of those- and I had a great massage by the massage therapist there. Before the one hour session I had been in pain for a few months and it was getting worse. It was hard to sit mostly. I was still able to exercise but then I couldn't do that. Even walking was uncomfortable and I've never had that happen. And sitting down to work was becoming impossible. So I made a one hour appt with Viv. When I met with her she told me I was carrying a lot of stress in my stomach and no one had ever told me that before. I'm sure she saw it visually but it was also an intuitive call. She then did some deep tissue work on my stomach that was l *quite* intense. She told me (at least this is my understanding of what she said) my stomach was so tight the muscles weren't able to engage and help my back leaving my back exhausted and weak from doing way too much work. She also worked on my shoulder. She also showed me how to stand properly. After that intense one hour session I rested. It took a few days but my back was TOTALLY better. I couldn't believe it. Money is tight for me now but paying for Viv is the best possible use of funds if you are in pain, especially if you can't work. Viv teaching me how to stand properly and have better posture was invaluable (and I bring to mind the four adjustments she made with me every day when I stand and walk). Viv also has me wearing a rib belt to help with posture.  This makes a huge difference. I want to add the massage I got there was very helpful. It was the most therapeutic massage I've ever had. And the therapist told me my tight quads were causing a huge problem. Although I stretch, i never got my quads much and I didn't realize how tight they were. I had been doing a lot of cardio without stretching them  and causing damage. it is great to be starting to learn what to do to prevent pain rather than just have it alleviated when it happens. Viv is also a fantastic person with a warm outgoing personality who genuinely cares about people. She is also deeply intuitive and hones in on things you don't expect. I'm so lucky she's just a few blocks away. The only reason not to go to Viv is if you enjoy being in pain. So if you do, don't go! Otherwise I highly recommend her. If you are hurting, she WILL help you. Thanks Vivian!",DBQXDlE9OgnAi8ITN53s0w,Claudia M.,90035

It was persistent enough for me to schedule an appointment with my general practitioner. I'm not a doctor, but was earnestly trying to self-diagnose. I thought perhaps it was food poisoning, a hernia or some sort of virus. I expressed my concerns with the doctor and to my surprise after about 5 minutes he concluded that I needed surgery. I was ushered to the receptionist area where I was to schedule the procedure with another doctor - a friend of his no doubt. Of course there would be no marathon this year, he remarked. I was dejected. I called my mother, a retired nurse, and she suggested that I get a second opinion. It was not long afterwards, that I was introduced to Vivian (alias: Superwoman). After discussing the situation, within minutes, Vivian told me that the problem was in my back. I confidently said, no, this is a stomach matter. Corrected again, she pulls off of her shelf what looked to be a Black's Medical Dictionary; it was huge. She thumbs through the pages - then voilà - there it was: an illustration of the back muscles wrapping around your waist to the stomach. She said, you may have a pinched nerve or something involving your L5 (I think), lie down here. Through multiple stretches and mobilizations - the pain was gone and has never returned. Further, my doctor has never once asked me about it. Ran the marathon in a personal best time. Whenever I see that metal I have Viv to thank. She is wonderful. She will make you a better person - the person you need to be. She will change your life - as with mine and others before me. Some people never find their calling - it's good to meet someone who truly has.""",TsXLEPNWXIOmlOzvjZB02g,Rick D.,90035

My scalp felt healthier after just a couple treatments and I could definitely tell the improvement of my hair thickness by the time I got married. A BIG thank you to Dr. Lee and her team! :),eK-xgn-lOFdypkKiVdZdog,Helen C.,90010

But now I have dandruff all over my scalp and its itching like crazy. Ever since I got the treatment the days go by its getting worse.

My scalp was red and burning and if I put my hand above it I could feel the heat. I hadn't been near the sun so I knew it had nothing to do with that. I went to a regular dermatologist and it didn't really help because they just speculated and gave me something to temporarily get rid of if but it later came back. I visited Dr. Lee about a month later and I'm so happy that I did. Not only did her staff greet me in the nicest way possible but the visit was thorough and I left there feeling like they truly wanted to help. They did a full on hair exam and scan of my follicules and it turned out it was mostly just stress and nerves. I myself was making so many assumptions that I was making it worse by overthinking. Dr. Lee called me down and told me I had nothing to worry about and she gave me a list of things to do and eat to help the inflammation go away and not come back again. She felt like family and am so grateful to have met her because she calmed me down and also took the time to listen to the things that were worrying me and keeping me stressed.

She took detailed pictures, thoroughly explained every detail of the procedure and kept checking in with me throughout the entire process - ensuring I was always comfortable and at ease.

My sister and I have been working with him since February 2015 and are still meeting with him every week to this day (literally--we worked out a couple hours ago, lol). I've always been skinny, but I've never felt healthier or stronger than I do now. But before I go too in depth, I want to preface this by saying that I absolutely HATE working out. Don't get me wrong, I love sports and other outdoor activities, but I wasn't getting the strength training I wanted. So I tried classes, videos, gyms--whatever you can think of--but could never find something I really enjoyed or could stick with. Being inside a gym just felt miserable and depressing, and I had no idea what I was doing--I would just hop on random machines, do a few sets, and hope I'd get results. I would get discouraged when I couldn't keep up with other people in a class or even do the exercises and movements correctly. That's where Matt came in--I was looking for an affordable personal trainer who would give me the attention I needed; someone who would encourage and support me--not yell at me or make me feel pathetic or lousy--and that's exactly what Matt does. Of course he challenges you and holds you accountable--he checks in to make sure we're doing our homework and even follows us on MyFitnessPal--but he is super friendly and understanding and works at your pace, tailoring each workout to your individual needs, concerns, and limitations. He doesn't judge you, but instead makes you feel comfortable and confident in what you're doing. All in all, I really think we hit the jackpot with Matt. So much so that we can't imagine working with any other personal trainer besides him. Sorry Matt, you're stuck with us!!!",UzuUlsO6dcvPlwZjUD6gFg,Lisa A.,90024

Beyond the workouts they even go as far as to keeping notes for every sessions so that you can further develop your strengths while combating your weaknesses, creating a cross fit training plan, and helping you with a diet plan.

Its been plenty times where I didn't pick up on a technique and instead of moving on and coming back to it later, he broke it down and attacked it from a different angle.

I have trained with these guys for 5 months and each class is a challenge and i have NEVER seen them half ass any lesson ever. what i like is that they document and follow your progress very closely- they have a master plan to develop you as a fighter (even if you are like me and never plan on fighting). In fact, you once you learn from these guys you begin to understand strategy better and start wanting to learn more and even spar even though again I have no intention of ever getting the in the ring. im pretty humbled (and exhausted) after my lessons.
