Definitely worth the almost hour long drive it usually takes me to get to the facility on Monday and Wednesday mornings.  The workouts are intense and I leave the studio feeling amazing.  The other women are great to train with and have a drive and passion for their training that I really admire.  A lot of pad work, some sparring when you're ready for it, and some ab/core work usually round out the daily workouts.  Unfortunately, I'm sidelined right now with a shoulder injury (unrelated), but you can bet I'll be back making the hour long drive as soon as I'm able to!",jX6X-AOSkn4LCjNZSq_GQQ,J V.,90036

I finally decided to get off my butt and work out again, but didn't want to go to one of the large, impersonal gyms I went to before. Enter Function 5 Fitness and Muay Thai. The gym is small, the classes are small - which is a good thing. You don't feel like a number here. This is definitely where the ""cool kids"" hang out. Lots of rock hard bodies with tattoos, dressed in black. Heck, the owner, Roxy, is a professional fighter so of course she's gonna be a bad ass! Other professional fighters train here, too. If that intimidates you, then don't come here. The classes are filled with a mix of people, but most are young and fit. If that bothers you, then don't come here. That said, the vibe is supportive. I feel like the biggest (and oldest) dork in the room. There's no way I make Muay Thai look cool. I still haven't gotten the moves right and I'm usually huffing and puffing with a bright red face. But, I like the workouts. I like punching and kicking - I NEED punching and kicking in my life. The instruction is top notch - emphasis on proper form with a non-judgmental attitude.

In all my research I kept coming back and checking out the F5 website. The price seemed right and the environment they projected looked really positive and inviting. Yesterday they were running a special deal on Yelp and I jumped on it. Natalie had the unfortunate task of helping me when I called. She helped me figure out what level class to jump into and also answered several other questions and helped me get into my first class there. A class that was already full, that I was trying to get into last minute, and at a sale price - she still did everything she could to help me while being incredibly sweet. I was half expecting a full blindside leg kick as I walked in the door (it would have been well deserved). Instead, I was greeted with a smile AND they let me borrow hand wraps (I forgot mine in my rush to make it to class). From there I started into the class that was being taught by Kate. She gave me some great instruction and ran a fun class that was a great workout. As we moved into the padwork, my eyes lit up. THEY HAVE FRESH GEAR! I grabbed the pads and to my surprise they still had cushion. If you've never worked pads, trust me this is huge. Most gyms live on their craptastic gear for ages.

Everyone is intent on technique and they are relentless in pushing you to do it correctly. The pairing can be challenging on any given day, but they do a terrific job in matching people, and quite frankly, catering the classes to the strengths and weaknesses of the pairings.

Y'know the drill, you wanna make change, blah, blah. The typical gym thing wasn't working out for me - most of the time I scurried away into the sauna and no one could stop me. Eventually, the stress, the frustration of the way I looked and felt was overwhelming. I came across F5, specifically interested in muay thai. I had tried it before, years ago, but at an (unwritten) all-men's sort of place. It was cool, I guess, if I had boy parts, but since I didn't, I was pretty much left in the back to sob alone and was never paid any attention to. After that, I gave up, so when the chance to try it again came up - I was hesitant for something similar to occur. ",-xumcwgTCHse-6taE_tHqQ,Shanyn W.,90036

But first a short background about myself. At one point when i was younger I was very active with sports (basketball). I use to play on a regular basis and eventually when you aren't apart of any leagues or teams it quickly becomes once in a while or hardly ever. Next thing you know its months then years pass since being active. I've done the usual join a gym go for a the first few weeks and eventually stop. Can't stand the gym crowds and not really having enough of a knowledge or initiative to create and stick to a gym regiment. ,GlI08hl2ktOzMkgTwy5Oog,Dihan A.,90036

I've been going to Bootcamp H20 consistently for just three months and I can easily say, it's the best and hardest workout I've had in my life. I have always been athletic and looking for challenging workouts, but in the past few years have had some serious back issues. The workouts that Igor leads are super intense, but with little to no impact on your joints (and my back, for that matter). You don't just swim laps, you are in and out of the pool, doing pushups, lunges, squats, and using weights nonstop for an hour. No workout is ever the same. Everyone I've met in the class has been doing this class with Igor for 2-4 years - real dedicated, and most of all strong with crazy endurance. I've gotten a lot stronger in the short time I've been going. You have to be able to swim at least freestyle. We do butterfly stroke a lot also, which I was terrible at, but after class one day recently Igor literally taught me how to do butterfly perfectly in, I kid you not, 20 minutes! Very impressive! I want to also mention that it's all ages, shapes, and sizes. And getting up for a 6 a.m. class seems awful, but you get used to it pretty quick.

They have classes ranging from early morning to evening, and the classes all seemed about the perfect size. You can sign up ahead of time online for a specific class. I am thinking about signing up because I really like the mix of weights, cardio and abs. It was challenging yet do-able. The instructor was great, super friendly and supportive. I like how the workouts changed from class to class and weren't the same ones. There are 9 stations and you do each one 3 times for 1min, and then you do abs as a group at the end. One station for example you would ride a stationary bike, and another station you would lift arm weights. There is a water fountain and free towels to use.

After training with Steven at another local gym and absolutely loving the experience, I knew I had to go in for a sweat session when I heard he opened up his very own gym. This place has everything you need when it comes to circuit training. It's a powerful and quick workout that will leave you panting on the floor, but it's guaranteed that you'll be back for more. The location is convenient with parking in the back and on the street. Inside is spacious, clean and organized.

In addition, I travel extensively on business every week and anyone else who does can attest to the fact that most hotel gyms leave a lot to be desired.  But with all of the new exercises I've learned from the wonderful staff at HIIT House LA I can turn virtually any gym into a workout mecca.  So if you're looking for a really FUN and equally EFFECTIVE workout routine, HIIT House LA is definitely the place you want to be!",oqKUAdUCqjiea3zAT-YoZw,Shane G.,90036

The work out is great for all levels because they provide modifications for each exercise to make it easier or harder dependent on level of experience. It's honestly the best and they treat all of their members really well and the gym has a great family vibe.

But now I'm moving HIIT House to the top of that list. There are 3 circuits of 3 exercises that you do for one minute each with a 15 second break in between. One station in each circuit is the air assault bike. I love this format because the bike keeps your heart rate up and the other stations are super challenging exercises, but because it's just a minute you can trick yourself into thinking that you can do anything for a minute, right? I also like that I get to revisit each station 3 times so that I feel like I've really mastered that specific exercise/muscle group before I move on. And then there's 5-10 minutes of abs at the end and you're out of there in under an hour. Finally, the price is right.

My roommate insisted that I give it a try especially considering the close proximity to my apartment! The phrase you never know until you try could never be more true. I was given the opportunity to try 3 classes for free before they officially opened the studio and I was HOOKED! Becoming a member at OTF was a no brainer for me. Each class feels like a personal training session even though you are working out with a group of people. The coaches are very well trained, knowledgable, and super fit, which is extremely important to me! There is nothing worse than going to a class where I can't take the instructor seriously! My personal favorites are Jessica and Drew. They bring amazing energy to each class, correct my form if I am not doing something right, play awesome music, and keep me pumped the entire 60 minutes of class. Also always pushing me to my limits. Nick is the most inspirational person I have ever met, easily! Don't even think about using the words ""I can't"" around him! The coaches will get to know you on a first name basis and they really strive to get you to where you want to be in terms of your fitness goals.

Introducing Pound!: Pound is a full-body cardio jam session, combining light resistance with constant simulated drumming. The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series. Burn between 600 and 900 calories per hour, strengthen and sculpt infrequently used muscles, and drum your way to a leaner, slimmer physique - all while rocking out to your favorite music!

Endurance Pilates:  55 minute group class on customized Pilates Reformers. Strength and endurance training, core and stability activation, full body workout. It burns, tones and promotes lean long muscles.

The Mashup:  25 minutes of Cardio Intervals on treadmills. Raises your heart rate, taxes your cardio-vascular system, gets you real sweaty and burns calories.

Almost a year later Diana still made good on her offer to let me try a class again free of charge which I thought was amazing.  I took a class with a different instructor and he was great! Once again I did the mash-up class and I felt the instructor was really paying close attention to everyone but still having fun.  I am also happy to report that the first thing he did was ask me if I had any injuries! Fitmix seems to be a really nice and supportive community and not just a place to take classes. I'm really glad I gave it another chance and kudos to Diana for reaching out to me and welcoming feedback to make the studio the best it can be.

This is my story and the reasons I'll forever be obsessed with Fitmix. I never enjoyed working out. I felt it was boring, time consuming and every weird method I tragically attempted I just ended up feeling stupid and I couldn't stick with anything. After a while I sort of gave up, but then joined Equinox (just never went) and was upset about how much weight I had put on over that past year with stress and working so much. I overheard some girls at my friends tanning salon talking about this awesome place called Fitmix where they took Pilates saying how great it was. I got the info and walked in blind never taking Pilates in my life for the free trial class they offer. Most places also after your ""free session"" you feel obligated and awkward because they try and immediately sell you a package, but not this place in ANY way! The environment, instructors, other clients, music, and everything about Fitmix sells itself bottom line. I became hooked and felt before my classes ended I already wanted to come again. I  ended up coming 3-4 times on average a week, and not only did it get me into loving fitness (which I thought was completely impossible) but the weight just came off ... a little over 15 pounds in 3-4 months and I've kept it off. Most important I don't care about the number of what I weight its that I feel stronger in every muscle of my body and it just showed me the trick is to never give up. Talking to other clients here everyone had different goals and reasons for coming here and the instructors accommodate everyone in the class accordingly and make you all feel motivated! My best friend also started coming with me and she loved this place just as much as I do. I'm a firm believer that the people MAKE the gym or wherever you go, and this place is a perfect example of that. Every instructor here is absolutely amazing, genuine, hilarious and so motivating you really can't have a bad experience no matter who you take a class from. I recently moved to New York and totally am having Fitmix withdrawals and can't imagine even going somewhere else to take Pilates! So anyone that went to Fitmix and moved to the east coast should start a petition with me to get Diana to open up a studio in New York because my life would be complete and it would do SOOOO well!!!!!!!! I miss all of you here so much!! XOXO :)",osf5HHMqwGLhiKcF7fG4pw,Lindsay S.,90036

I was normally a big runner, Pilates, and Barre person. Lift Society stood out to me among other studios because unlike other lift-focused gyms, they emphasize the importance of FORM before trying to stack on the weights. They have a perfect variety of classes, if one would like more cardio they can take kettlebell. I personally love the Glutes and Total Lift classes. Just within 6 weeks of 4X a week, I saw massive results on my body that I've never seen before.

I've always found it a motivating, challenging gym with small classes that feel like personal training sessions. They started classes focused on Olympic Lifting and Heaving Lifting a year ago, and I fell in love. People are always scared of the idea of lifting because they're afraid of bulking up, but weight lifting gets you lean and strong. It's very empowering to exceed your personal expectations and realize how strong you really are, and how strong you can be. What Dave and Dylan do so well is that they tailor a program to students of all levels. In the Lift classes there are level two and three workouts that you can do, so everyone can work towards their own personal fitness goals.

I love it so much that when I needed to move, I made sure I was still within easy walking/driving distance so I could continue taking the 6am classes before work and personal training after work. As background, I am a runner - marathons and half marathons -- and I've always loved fitness and have committed at times to pilates, boxing, cycling, etc. However, I have never been as toned and as strong as when I train at Lift Society. I make an effort to train consistently 3-4 times a week at Lift Society, run a couple times a week and do yoga every week or so. The Lift Society program has given me a great body shape and rounded out my fitness. The Lift Society body look is definitely the fitspo look that has taken over social media! Because I am building more muscle by lifting heavier, I am burning more calories when resting and I've found that as long as I am consistently training and primarily eating clean, I don't need to be super strict about my food portions and occasional treats like I used to be in order to maintain my fitness/shape. The trainers are experts in power and/or Olympic lifting and practice/compete in it in their free time. They are attentive to form, which is what produces results. Finally, Lift Society is primarily attended by members who had to express a genuine interest and commitment to sign up so you get to know like-minded people in your classes and develop a community that motivates attendance.

Anyway, I am pretty much satisfied with the membership only for one glitch. when I signed up I was told that there will be 3 free sessions with the facility fitness trainors. that I will be contacted via my phone or email to schedule the said sessions. I received NO communications whatsoever going into my second week so I followed up with the reception and again they took my contact information and was promised that I will be receiving a call.or email from one of the trainors. Going 2 mos now and still no call from anybody in the facility. Well, I do not really care about having a trainor breathing down my neck while I am.working out. I had a personal trainor when I started working out a year or two ago so I am confident I have at least the basic know how on how to do things. I did not ask for this 3 free sessions, it must be a part of their marketing strategy to lure clients in so it may be a good idea to make sure that they follow up on their promises across their culturally diversed clients and not only to their fellow Koreans. I have other reasons why I picked the facility so I will be going there until I find a better place to go to (well, I am contracted up to a year lol).",JGQUUpJdlI_88-o8yKhDGw,Leon N.,90005

Then I spent years trying to fix it, studying about nutrition and trying to understand how to put my muscle mass back on without gaining fat. A failure after the other. I've been doing cardio only and counting calories to an insane level for years, until my husband took me to Lift Society. I went only because I wanted to keep him company and try this together. When I found out how challenging it was and how interested I was into learning new movements and get stronger I couldn't stop anymore. I dropped any other sport and I started to lift 4 or 5 times a week, to see how far I could get, how could I fix my body, trusting my teachers because - let's say it - THEY LOOK SO GOOD! I trusted them and that was the best idea I've ever had. I train at Lift Society since 2 years, I lift way more than my own weight and, above all, I am the healthiest that I've ever been.

I was a member for essentially two years. Lift Society is the place to train, whether you're completely new to lifting or a veteran of the iron game. I originally joined for Olympic Weightlifting but shifted towards more power building and aesthetics. Before joining this gym, I never directly trained my glutes. The new training methodology along with the coaching helped me hit new PRs in my squats and deadlifts. I also joined LS several months after I tore my pec while benching elsewhere, and having both a coach keeping an eye on it and having a spotter helped me feel confidently under the bar again when it comes bench presses. Dave and Dylan assembled an impressive coaching cadre and has created quite an awesome and welcoming community. All the coaches have their own styles, yet they also follow a consistent programming (quick shout out to Luci for drilling proper glute engagement when squatting as that has stuck with me to this day). Although I'm no longer a member (esp. considering that I live in another county now), I'd rejoin in a heartbeat if I return the area and the class schedule fits my crazy work schedule. When I was living in Burbank and before the Studio City location opened, I was making the commute over the hill (and on some days, during rush hour), and it was worth it due to the quality of the training. Highly recommend Lift Society overall! Great place to train for aesthetics and/or athletic performance.",-iLNy-HTKyRrkXOOo2AnNw,Tony H.,90046

That led to me being invited to try out the classes at Rise Nation. I was nervous and worried that I would be in a room full of fit, pretty people and be self-conscious however that wasn't the case. Yes you will see lots of attractive fit people but you will meet people from all walks of life that are there to be healthy and encourage eachother. The trainers there are so warm, positive, encouraging and welcoming, and the staff that runs the place treats everyone with genuine excitement. I never thought I would feel at home in fitness environment but I look forward to going and I now go about 3 times a week. I have started seeing real results and weight loss and I know I couldn't have done it with out the people at Rise. If you only take one class here take it from Loui, his class is fun to take, the music is always on point and if you're lucky you might even get a bit of dance choreography from him on the stage :-)   That being said every trainer there will motivate and inspire you!

Staff was attentive and super friendly.  I've had multiple surgeries on my neck/spine and this workout put zero pressure or impact on it. It's perfectly designed to keep your body aligned.

It's as efficient of a workout as it gets. 30 hard minutes on a versa climber and you're out the door and feeling like you got a great workout. I LOVE KATIE! She's my favorite instructor! Definitely take her class. Not only is she adorable with such an amazing body (#fitspo), she goes out of her way to introduce herself to everyone in the class. She makes you feel so welcome and she's very encouraging and motivating during class. She is your biggest cheerleader. Plus, she plays such fun, up-beat music. She plays hip hop, pop, the works. She switches up the workout too. So each song she does a variety of moves on the climber that you didn't know you could do on that machine. Regarding the studio, the room itself is all black. They shut the lights off and pull the blinds down and have color-changing ceiling so it's almost like you're at a nightclub. That way you can workout without feeling insecure or that people are watching you. They have water for purchase or they have a machine you can refill your bottle with. They also provide a sweat towel at each machine. There's an outdoor patio too. Friendly staff! I highly recommend it.",hG_n4kQAb_TY0xSCoX6ssA,Brittany L.,90069

The benefit of this workout is it has a lot of punch packed into 30 minutes. You can get in and out and feel like you got a lot done. The class I recently went to was a free community class, which I happen to see on their email blast. Free workout? YES please! I told the staff I hadn't been there in 2 years, so I wanted to be treated as a newbie. They were so friendly. I think they might have the friendlies staff out of any fitness studio I've been to. They set me up on my machine, and after class told me how great I did, which was a good confidence booster. They have a big patio outside, good for cooling down after class.

But all she did was count. Which is fine but then half the class she was on her cell phone recording and i assume snap chatting her counting. I wasn't motivated at all and annoyed at her lack of focus. She didn't even tell us before hand that she will record. She just did it.

The exercise is quite difficult while you're doing it, but I didn't feel any impact or exhaustion of muscles afterwards the way I would with running, Lagree method, or HIIT, my other go-to exercises. Maybe that is a good thing? I just don't know if I believe the ""whole body workout"" hype--to me, it just seemed like cardio. Then again, maybe I wasn't doing it right. In the end, for what feels like a cardio workout to me, I don't really like the repetitive, dark room scenario when we live in LA and could take it outside almost every day.",qGre3EMXgwFwn8MKrz_8bw,Katie M.,90069

I went in thinking this class would be a cinch since it's just 30 min. Boy was I wrong! Talk about a high intensity, FULL body workout! I had to stop a few times cause I couldn't keep up, but that only motivated me to get my butt into these classes on a regular basis so I can get my stamina up. Clean, hip, great music, kind staff, lots of parking. Machine is intimidating at first, but after a few minutes you'll get the hang of it, if not just ask for help from one of the kind staff members. Devin was my instructor and he is PERFECTION . I don't think I've ever seen such an incredible body on a man. If his body alone doesn't motivate you I don't know what will.

The good thing about Rise Nation is that class is only 30 mins!  I loved Adam's energy and his song choices were on point.  The music can be quite loud, but earplugs are available if needed.  Also towels and a water refilling station are provided.  So overall, Rise is a fun place to burn a ton of calories in a short amount of time.",HO36s3KV8D5TLLMr2GgEpw,Truc N.,90069

Got out of the class about an hour ago and I am sore beyond belief! I had never even seen a versaclimber before so I was super intimidated but let me assure you they're super easy to use. I obviously took the intro class and fell in love. The music definitely pumps you up and the dark room with the cool lights make it feel like you're at a club and not a studio.

The Versaclimber is a tough machine, but it doesn't feel so tough with lots of people working alongside you. If you have any joint issues, I'd start with some bracing or compression until you're sure you're OK, then reduce the support level as you feel more comfortable. I can't do really long cardio workouts and using most of your body at the same time ensures you work up a sweat quickly, for me, in the first minute. Because everyone is generally looking at their own readings and their own pace, I never worried about whether I was keeping up or not.  You do what you can do and challenge your last time and adherence to the patterns. No bad instructors here, and it looks like Russell and Britney are very positive, while Chenelle is quite passionate and will work you very hard in the Level 2 classes at WeHo.

The studio is super clean, friendly staff, amazing instructors (Shout out to Ashleigh...Hey girl! ‍"") and really good music. The only down side is parking can be hard to find, but I suggest arriving 20-30 mins earlier to allow yourself time to find parking.

The facilities are so clean and gorgeous and the front desk is welcoming and not pushy about joining. They let you know the specials after class but that's about it. As for the class...there's a filtered water fountain to fill your bottle with it and trust me you'll need it. It's only 30 minutes but it kicks your butt. The Versa Climber is easy to use and comfortable on your joints but don't fight it, once you find your groove it's awesome. Chandler was an awesome instructor for the class and took you thru all the basic moves perfectly! Her song mix was awesome. Once the class starts they lower the black out blinds and the fun begins because the whole jagged rock climbingesque ceiling lights up with the most incredible distracting light show to take your mind off how intense the work out is. It was literally the coolest most awesome cardio I've ever done and when I was done I felt like my joints weren't worn but that I had really worked every muscle group and couldn't wait to do it again.

I tried a few of the different classes and two different instructors.  Depends on the teacher, your physical limitations, their knowledge of modifications and injuries and how they work with you for one to really enjoy it and the get most out of it. One trainer somehow felt that if you weren't working like you were on the Biggest Loser, you weren't getting ANY benefits. I did fast walking on the treadmill and compensated by going more uphill and felt sweaty and heart racing. That wasn't enough for him. As we know from any physical therapist or trainer, or health practitioner, any amount of walking (30min a day) will even be of benefit. The second trainer was awesome and worked with my limitations. She was much younger than I, and even she admitted to ""blowing out my hip"" from all of her running. At my age (over 45) and with my sports injuries, the last thing I'd want to do is injure myself further. They key word is ""push you to YOUR limit,"" but YOU have to know YOUR body!""",FhvVRwNT4bJnwFLqBEMIWQ,joslyn l.,90036

Fitmix is one of the most awesome studios of any kind I have ever worked out in. The small classes give you the personalized attention we all crave, however the high ceilings, ventilation, and spaciousness of the studio help to avoid feeling like you are working out on top of your neighbor. Diana and Brian are AMAZING! Their varying styles allow me to set my pilates schedule just right so I get just enough burn for my butt (oops I meant ""burn for my buck"" but the other works too)... Diana is known for throwing out an enthusiastic ""Yeah"" every so often which lets you know that she hasn't forgotten about you and she's watching that stopwatch. Brian will often break into a soul clap which helps to take your mind off that shaking in your thigh and that burn in your backside. Sarah's ""fist pounds all around""  is one of the most supportive rewards one could hope for (next to a double portion of chocolate lava cake) after a conquering her ""rolling hills"" during Mashup. I am so pleased with how my mind and body have changed since stepping into Fitmix. The Fitmix squad took someone who wasn't runner and hadn't done pilates in 3 years and turned her into a running, breathing, pulsing, holding, burning, holding, focusing, holding, releasing, resisting, pushing, maniac!

On my quest to get in shape for the summer I stumbled across Fitmix Studio in West Hollywood & boy am I glad I did!! From the moment I first walked into the studio I felt at home. The space is very inviting and both Diana and Brian are super friendly, attentive, and down to earth. Previous to attending the studio, I had been taking pilates at another studio in Studio City but Fitmix really makes you break a sweat! The first pilates class I took was with Diana and I could definetely feel the burn. The second class I took was with Brian and let me tell you, that was definetely a ""I just got my ass kicked in pilates class"" experience! Wow!!! He makes sure you work hard and to your full potential & he keeps a very close eye on you so you don't slack off!!! Not to mention, he was constantly correcting my form making sure I was doinng each move precicely and effectively!

Someone emailed me from there and informed me that some classes were open, so I was luckily free and slipped into an 8:30pm class. It was definitely an intense workout. Especially, if you're not used to doing pilates on a regular basis. At one point, I kind of collapsed in laughter because I had maxed out on these push up to elbow planks we were doing 3/4 of the way into the class. I think the rest of the ladies in the class were doing a lot better than me, which just goes to show that you can get a lot stronger. I'd really like to go again since it's in the neighborhood. I just can't figure out how I'm going to afford it as a student. Even the student price is steep when you don't have a job.

From check-in to warm-up right down to ab finishers, I felt none of that ""exclusive"" standoffishness that so many LA gyms present, whether intentionally or not. The membership fit into a full spectrum of age, gender, and body types - from casual ClassPassers like me to actual fitness professionals - and the teachers were total rockstars, Kinsey in particular.

Hiit house was my first gym in LA, I stayed with them for about 8 months and I loved it so much. I only quit because I moved in another part of the town. What I really like about this gym is that I was able to take any classes without being worried about who will teach cause all the coaches are very nice and officient. The circuits are always well balance and the coaches will always well explain all the exercices. They will correct you individually and you will be sore after each session. Since everything is made to give you the best experience, the people who train over there are always in the best condition to contribute to the good ambiance. You can also make friends since mixers are organize once on a while. And last but not least, prices are very reasonable compare to what you can pay in LA. Highly recommended.",BIFauNKcD9GwPzW-u3rjew,Morgan M.,90036
"HIIT House LA is a 50 minute HIIT (high intensity interval training) program.

Each class is separated into 3 circuits of 3 Exercises (performed for a minute each), that you will complete 3 times. Why repeat the same exercise 3 times?  It often takes a minute to truly master proper form.
We want you safe and working efficiently! So, first round of the circuit is all about getting the form down, second is about about getting stronger and the third time through is about crushing the exercises.
The workouts are presented in two flavors:

BUILD: 

Whether your goal is hypertrophy (gaining muscle mass) or long and lean muscles, this is the class for you!  You will be put through 3 circuits of 3 exercises 3 times!

I did the shred and run class, and managed to run faster and further than I ever would've pushed myself, even AFTER a good 25 minutes of intense, slow muscle work on the machine. I found abdominal muscles that I didn't even know I had. This was my first time on a megaformer, but I still found the movements easy to follow and replicate, and Jennifer took extra time with correcting form for beginners. My booty is still feeling the burn of those deep hip extensions. A few weeks of this would have you swimsuit ready in no time. It's a bit expensive once you're done with the new member package, so unless you're willing to fork out some serious $$ towards your fitness goals, I'd use this as an occasional full-body workout that will help push you past your regular workout plateaus.",1nQQqMf9Mt6Zfy4SPd5dAg,Cindy H.,90041
