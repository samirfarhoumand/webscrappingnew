I first met him as a group fitness instructor at a local fitness studio and he was far and away one of the best fitness instructors I had ever encountered. It should go without saying that he was great at the fundamentals of his job - he understands movement, how to exercise safely, can offer relevant modifications, understands the importance of good form, proper timing, gives clear, concise instructions, etc. - but he also has a great personality and infectious enthusiasm that makes him a pleasure to work out with. And it's not just me - everyone loved his classes. ",N-DPBcX1IOxNEAcrIjn2zg,Kevin D.,90068

Well let's start by saying I'm going to keep this as civil as possible but I can no longer keep quite about this place. Terrible service and a rotating staff so you really don't know who to talk to when it comes to serious issues like spending 2k on golf lessons which started off great but after my fourth lesson my golf coach was let go and I was never notified via email nor call to inform me of the change. Finally when I contacted the store they were in the process of a new golf coach which by that time I did not want the lessons because of the way I was handled or just the fact I wasn't given the option on a refund but here is the kicker it's been 2 years !!! Smh ! I've tried to resolve the issue with 2 personal friends of the owner Steven Malbon and I was told ""Invest In Golf"" which was relayed to me which is there Instagram hashtag! Really! Fast forward I was diagnosed with Covid 19 and went thru a real hardship so since services were never rendered and I was charged I asked for a refund again or exchange of clothing they sell @ the store and again  I was rejected!!! I'm a minority I'm not rich I work hard and given the situation and this guy claiming to bring golf to younger generations and inner city yeah right!Just another greedy white guy trying to get over I bet if I was one of these celebrities he hob nobs with I would have been taken care of ....",giiVNIoGJoPUy-F66xEa9A,Frank L.,90046

Basically I was seen by Dr. Diane who prescribes a bunch of supplements. I felt like I was just throwing money. Diane seamed very distracted in every appointment and she kept saying that I am ""getting better and I don't even know it"". That was not funny to me. She was inconsistent in her advice. For example she emphasized that I have to stay away from any sugar but she said to eat some cereal which, when I purchased it, I saw it has sugar. Some of the things that were irritating were that she did not even look at my skin, and did not talk about psoriasis but about parasites. It sort of felt like that office is some different planet... In the beginning she said to call her every week. I was very happy about that because I was really desperate in pain and I needed to be taken care of. She quickly changed that and said there is no need to call that often. According to the biomeridian I got rid of 3 out of 4 bugs but I, unfortunately, do not believe in their diagnosis and methods. I regret spending so much money there. The worst thing: I was not able to quit the supplements because she was saying that if I stop the parasites would multiply. OMG!

I found the classes to be pretty chaotic and disorganized. Master Davis was hardly present during our classes on week night evenings. His assistant teachers were ok but compared to the prices at other TKD classes in Ktown you would think the master would be present. For the price you pay here for just once a week you can go to another (better organized, better run) place in Ktown for 3x/weekly classes. I don't know if the adult classes are better run and that's why the rating is so high but for young kids you can definitely find better. MUSA felt more in line with some place like MyGym or some other kids gym. Kids run around and get some energy out but don't learn any discipline or skills.

-New Guidelines-

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use. We will provide disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer to all members.",2306 Hyperion Ave,5.0,"Trainers,Boot Camps,Weight Loss,Centers",Velocity Boot Camp,35,5,Silver Lake,1/20/2020,"I was first introduced to Velocity Boot Camp in June, 2019 when I took a free one-week trial class. I had been looking for a gym to join, but wasn't sure ""boot camp"" was the right fit. I leaned more towards yoga and walking, but was open to something more rigorous that could provide resistance and strength training. Matt's class did not disappoint! I was sore for at least two weeks and cursed having to get up at 6:30am to get to the 7am class, but here I am - 7 months later - a devout fan & addict. I am healthier, stronger, and have more stamina. Those heavy, Costco-sized bags of dog food? No problem. I just toss 'em in my cart.  Matt is a super nice guy and has designed a challenging yet do-able program that delivers 100%.",bJ50cquUC_OYg81400zKXQ,Pamela T.,90027

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use. We will provide disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer to all members.",2306 Hyperion Ave,5.0,"Trainers,Boot Camps,Weight Loss,Centers",Velocity Boot Camp,35,5,Silver Lake,4/6/2016,Hard workouts made easy!

I've been here through thick and thin, from bandaids and bloodstains around the bathroom sink to the staff finding a dead guy in the steam room. 13 years of crazy antics and I've never once complained. Until today. The current manager, Zack, is about as bad as they come. The addition of Sprouts has resulted in new parking logistics. Today (11/5/19) was my first time to park in the newly revamped parking structure. Gym members now pay more for parking (now $2.50 for 2 hours), while Sprouts customers get an hour for free. I walked in today and asked for parking validation upon checking in. For whatever reason, the validation machine didn't work on my ticket. The front desk clerk asked Zack (the general manager) to assist. Zack shrugged his shoulders and said, ""You're going to have to take it up with them [the parking people]."" The response and tone were so dismissive that the front desk clerk politely interjected and said, ""Swing by after your workout and we'll try it again."" As I walked to the changing room, I noticed a parking attendant positioned inside the gym, presumably there to help ease problems with the new parking system. I went back up to the front desk and pointed out that Zack could have simply directed me to the parking attendant stationed INSIDE the gym. Zack replied, ""He doesn't know what he's doing. He's just some guy they made stand there."" I was taken aback by the response.  I asked to speak to the manager. Zack informed me that he was the manager, which shocked me given his poor customer service skills. I asked for the number for corporate. Zack laughed in my face. Shocked, I asked, ""Are you laughing at me?"" He smugly replied, ""Yes."" You get the idea. ",OKCesgNu9WclcAwDrNfRQg,Ragan F.,90069

The production value and professionalism of the young performers was spectacular.  Both my boys (ages 5 & 8), at once, wanted to take classes with the now famous Stella, the director of the show.  In fact, my 3rd grader, decided that he and his best friend would learn a HIP HOP dance from Stellar Dance Studio and perform it for the school's talent show.  Stella worked patiently with the kids and helped prepare them for the talent show!  To this day, my son thanks, Stella for making him feel so successful and ""popular!""  The performance brought our whole family to tears and the rest of the school audience: parents, teachers and kids alike to their feet for a howling standing ovation!  Because this was the first time our ""Autsome"" son, was able to perform on stage without a meltdown!!!  A major accomplishment, we don't think would have been possible without Stella.  Now, both my sons attend Stellar dance studio and when my 5 year old was cast in a major role in the most recent production of Pinocchio, I knew it was because of his dance training.  During rehearsals, back stage, I saw the love and encouragement Stella imparted to my younger son before his show.  It was touching!  Finally, my husband and I have decided to enjoy a night out and started attending ""beginning Salsa dancing classes"" at Stellar Dance Studio too, taught by Dennis and Stella.  We love it!!!  Thank you Stella for creating such positive energy in the neighborhood and imparting my whole family with the love of dance!",57_35fX9XC-34azXCvqX1Q,Victoria B.,90046

They were very friendly and helpful from the get-go. I told them about my scalp concerns and the symptoms I've been experiencing. They recommended I come in for the Itchy and Flaky scalp treatment. I got to see my scalp with a microscopic camera, at 60x magnified, and I was amazed to see how much inflammation and buildup I had on my scalp. The scalp treatment I got was wonderful it left my scalp feeling refreshed and clean. They recommended I come back to treat the inflammation on the scalp since I had so much, they said it was going to take more than one treatment to get rid of most of it. I will definitely be coming back for regular treatments. I also noticed they offer acupuncture and I will be giving that a try.

It was a challenging but forgiving hike so beginners or weekend hikers such as myself could all participate and enjoy. Upon returning we had a delicious homemade organic and healthy meal. I am a certified nutritionist so I took particular appreciation of the menu. We then were able to listen to a truly inspiring motivational talk by Sara Safari which was both humbling and inspiring.

Now when I try and make an appointment I'm being told it's a higher fee again for every 'new' issue a patient may have??!!!! I don't appreciate being told different things. Better to be honest about your fees upfront. It just seems very dodgy and money focused even if the therapy is good. Of course we would only visit a physiotherapist if we had an issue. .....

I have never experienced a medical professional that expresses so much personal investment in the well-being of her clients. I had initially put off going to physical therapy to address my posture and back/shoulder pain because I was afraid of finding a practitioner that was simply going to hand me a list exercises and send me home. Vivie took the time to figure out what was going on in my life, and patiently worked her magic and tried to keep me more accountable. I should say, if you're looking for someone who just sees you as a medical case and not a human being then you should go somewhere else. Vivie is exclusively human in her approach: she's sharp as a tack, has four cute dogs running around her home/therapy center, and will occasionally bring up a funny Facebook video to distract you if she's working on something painful. If more people were as vivacious and proactive as her, this world would be a better place. :) Her massage therapist Marzia is also increeeedible, both incredibly soothing and intuitive.

Even more amazingly, when your mind feels safe, that voice in your head becomes quiet!

My pain levels had become unbearable. I immediately noticed the benefits of the Pilates exercises that Kathleen customized for my condition, and she developed a home program upon releasing me from her care.  Twenty-three years later, there were structural, scoliosis-related changes in my body that started causing severe pain again. When my orthopedist referred me to a physical therapy facility, I decided to go back to Kathleen Carman because of the success we've had before.  As in my previous experience with Kathleen, my pain levels after the first session were noticeably less pronounced. I have noticed improved flexibility, posture and balance. For my most recent issues, Kathleen did several things: (1) She addressed the changes in my body and developed new exercises; (2) she adjusted the techniques on some of the original exercises; and (3) she eliminated a few of the original exercises if they were no longer possible for me to perform and replaced them with exercises that had the same beneficial effects.

There are no levels in Bhaktivedanta Yoga classes because true progress is marked by a subtle inner process rather than just by greater flexibility or physical stamina.

Vishnu Das is a great teacher who modulates his teaching style to accommodate each student based on their varying levels of expertise. I'm still a beginner and he is always gentle and encouraging with me and he pushes the other students that are more advanced. The class is both very challenging (I'm shocked at how quickly I can work up a sweat during the Sun Salutations) and extremely relaxing (class both begins and ends with relaxation exercises with Vishnu Das playing the harmonium). I'm totally hooked and try to take his classes three times a week. And an added bonus is that you can use the spa facilities upstairs after the workout!

"Dating back several hundred years, Bujinkan (武神館) martial arts training includes unarmed self-defense (i.e. strikes, throws, holds, chokes, joint-locks) and weapons training that relies on natural body movement (not muscles).
 
Traditional Martial Art's focus on developing the leadership capacities needed to meet tomorrow's challenges with an edge over the competition. Aside from aspects that enable one to navigate defensive situations, partner scenario training, develops self-awareness, self-regulation and the transferable skills that are essential for tomorrow's workplace and societal leaders.
 
To be successful in today's demanding economic environment, organizations need dynamic leaders that possess the willingness to take calculated risk, think creatively, solve problems quickly, and adapt to an ever-changing competitive landscape.
 
Modern athletes train their body and mind to rise above the average human performance and to achieve greater rewards in life. Today, we practice the martial arts to be part of a larger community. Build self-confidence. To learn how to be a compassionate human being. And to realize our potential. 

Franklin Canyon Bujinkan is a gender neutral, intergenerational, culturally diverse, youth and adult self-development program. We train outdoors in the park to be closer to nature.

What I experienced was a profound moment which forever has changed/impacted my life in a positive, healthy way. Who knew pole dancing would offer this? Certainly not a busy healthcare professional like me! I cannot imagine not having Sfactor in my life. This practice, the instructors, the women here ALL are genuine, open, & absolutely cultivate much more than a ""typical pole dancing class."" Never have I lived a more fulfilling and complete life, inside and outside of the walls of the studio than since I have made this a part of my life. Boundaries, improved & meaningful relationships with BOTH men & women, healthy lifestyle & fitness, and my ""voice"" in all areas of my life is now the clearest and genuine ever. No longer am I not taking care of myself or playing victim, I now feel as the captain of my true self & destiny. I highly recommend Sfactor for women of all walks of life & physical levels.

After taking the intro class, I am currently taking Level 1. The class I'm in is really small, which is both good and bad. Good because there's more space to move and more time on the pole, but there's also constant stream of other people taking advantage of the open membership plan, which must be great for them but not so fabulous for me. During the very first Level 1 class, for example, while I was still trying to master the firefly, they were spinning around, doing much more advanced tricks and sucking up the instructor's attention. I feel like it defeats the purpose of having levels.",1Bx7Pg9t89DinwsGwSDB-Q,Margs K.,90036

He had dispatched one of his nurse's to come see us immediately. Without boring you with the rest of the details, all we can say is that we were treated so beautifully by him and all the staff we interacted with, starting from the gatekeeper/receptionist.

The jump is significant. But this week I went to both - Salsa 1 taught by Kelly and 1.5 by Oscar - and was pretty amazed at how simple and easy 1 seemed to me. So I must be getting better!

"Fitness. Yoga. Coaching.

Your outer world is a reflection of your inner world.

You are not your story - my philosophy is taking a step back, looking at the whole picture, taking responsibility of the things we CAN control, and letting go of the rest.

You are where you are for a reason. Let's learn the lessons we need to to learn from our pasts, identify exactly where we are in the Right Now, and become more self-aware in our intentional steps moving forward.

The way you can make an impact on the world around you is by becoming the truest version of yourself, one decision at a time.

The way you make better decisions is developing an ongoing ""toolbox"" you can pull from, and spending the time getting to know yourself.

The way you get to know yourself better is by approaching yourself, your relationships, and your life with innate curiosity, rather than judgement or ""knowing.""

To start getting better answers from life, let's start asking better questions -- together.","Marina del Rey, CA 90292",5.0,"Life Coach,Yoga,Boot Camps",Angel Najarian,1,5,,4/6/2020,"Angel will ask you all the powerful, thought provoking questions you've been afraid to ask yourself and then challenge you to answer them with your mind, body and soul.

The process of finding a good teacher was daunting and I was concerned about looking like a fool in class. After all, I had two left feet. Was it even possible that I could dance to music without stepping on my partner's toes? I scoured the internet (the thing that Al Gore invented) to find a good dance studio and came upon 'Ballroom Dance Academy' run by Natalia and Michael. The thing that set them apart from the other dance studios (that I had researched) was the way they had structured the dance program. Their DVIDA based program has 8 dances in two levels over the span of 5 months (one does not have to follow the full program. You could choose to learn just one dance if you so wish). So the first month you take one Latin and one ballroom level I class. The following month you will start level II of these dances, but can also start level I of the next two dances. Thus over a span of five months, you learn 8 dances. One can then start level III if you would like to continue learning or you could use what you have learnt in levels I and II to dance socially. Interestingly I thought I would show up for a couple of classes, but ended up enjoying myself so much, that I am now doing level III of the program. ",OB3FYurhy6S6YZ6AiCmZRQ,Nikhil S.,90038

Initially, I was reluctant to take a salsa class alone because I thought it was for couples. I was wrong. The class had plenty of individual men and women as well as some couples. Plus, everyone rotates during the class which gave us all an opportunity to dance with a variety of dancers. After taking my first salsa class with the Ballroom Dance Academy, I was hooked. The teachers are fantastic and you meet a lot of nice people. They even have nights that the class meets at a local salsa club and we get to practice our moves in a club setting. Going to a salsa club used to be intimidating to me because the ladies expect the men to lead and to know what they're doing.

She was able to target the one area that needed the most work and encouraged me to do my own healing with meditation. I felt the affect of her energy the next morning when I was able to get 8 hours of sleep! I was surprised and so thankful for this.

From help with the song selection, to choreography, to cutting the music just the way we liked it, they were fantastic! With only 8 weeks to accomplish all of this, Krista and Kelvin did amazing with the 5 dance lessons we took with them. They were patient, kind, and supportive through the whole process. They are clearly a fantastic team together and working with 2 seasoned dance instructors really makes a difference. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to learn a first dance, or even just want to have a fun date night!",jbSQGG1ukh7qJquEFTk_gQ,Zeeshan S.,90036

As someone who has truly been terrified of dancing his whole life, to the point of complete avoidance, to becoming someone who felt confident and excited to do his first dance, I can honestly say I owe so much thanks and gratitude to Krista and Kelvin. Without even trying, their personalities and demeanor, did something to make me feel comfortable in my vulnerability and I can't say enough about how truly enjoyable the experience was. Not to mention with their guidance we were able to achieve the desired result of having a kickass choreographed dance with sophisticated moves that looked like we were a couple who danced all the time. Not only that, but they went beyond the first dance, and gave us techniques and moves to use together for any kind of music. ",vmaTKTXHXw-IFxG3DuDFpQ,Michael G.,90036

Fortunately, we found Krista and Kelvin and they created a dance sequence for us (based on our vision), they taught us several different styles of dance (in easy to digest bits), and they created an audio file of our two songs (with edits) that we gave to our DJ to play on our wedding night. We had an absolute blast at the dance lessons, they were the highlight of our wedding planning. We also crushed the first dance as Krista and Kelvin did such a marvelous job prepping us.

I already had a pretty clean diet, but Jackie has helped me get on a better eating schedule - incorporating healthy snacks between meals - and make even healthier choices for meals.

I wanted to do a private session and let me TELL YOU. I was absolutely blown away of how powerful she is. The moment we started I felt like I was dropped in mid air and floating.

It got so bad that the doctors wanted to put me on medication and that's not what I wanted for myself.  I tried brain wave therapy, psychologist, nutritionist, chiropractor, Accupuncture, reiki healing, soundbaths, prayer and many more things. All of them helped a little bit but nothing like this work that Susanna does. After the first session, I noticed that my week was a little better. I just felt like this was the thing that was going to help me the most because it is very intimate and she really cares about you so much.  In class, we do breathing exercises while she calmly talks to you. Followed by a 10 minute meditation and then a 10 minute qigong session. I look forward to this class every week. Getting rid of anxiety is not a one day or one week thing. It is a constant work. With this work I have felt the most advancement and have not had major anxiety for almost a year now since I've been going.  I would really recommend this to anyone suffering from any anxiety or stress in life.   It really works.  I feel really safe and comforted when I am there.",37BMG1LtXX8Jc3UmUsFxRQ,Abe M.,90068

I am stronger, longer and leaner than ever. Her approach is very specific, effective and therapeutic, my body literally craves my Michellates sessions. She is a rock star instructor. The best of the best!",vlnD5G-usQ2mZUF-uSYFMQ,Meghan S.,90019

My core is dramatically stronger, and I have had significantly less sciatica flare-ups. If you have any injuries or stubborn chronic pain, Michellates is your best choice for conscientious workouts that will help you work toward correcting/alleviating those issues. The acute attention to detail, form, and breathing that I have learned working with Michelle has made me more mindful in my daily activities--as I carry a full load of groceries, I think of keeping my shoulders down away from my ears and engaging my lats and serratus, when I sit in a chair without a back rest, I sit up tall on my sit-bones and engage my abs, etc. It's amazing what a body will do for you if you treat it right.

She is an absolute expert and also has the best bedside manner you could wish for from someone you're going to get so intimate with. She's respectful, gentle, warm, understanding and made me feel very safe, comfortable and relaxed. I've seen two other pelvic PTs on the Westside and neither gave me the results or the experience I got with Grace. I've continued seeing her for other issues and she has engineered amazing change in my body in areas multiple other practitioners have failed to. Kneeling has been impossible for me for as long as I can remember and after a few sessions with Grace I can do it with ease which to me is remarkable. She is the absolute best in the business, I'll never see another PT again.",gdzXxDWPbmVjFLX_yLx6zQ,M S.,90066

I found this adventure with The Travel Yogi in  Iceland to be a refreshing for the soul. Iceland is a place unlike any I've ever visited. Yoga with Alice was oh so delicious - and with Tyffi, the best tour guide in the world - we saw majestic glaciers grind their way through cracked lava fields, gushing geysers explode with a powerful force, glittering ice caps pierce the sky as we rested in the mist of geothermal lagoons (which is like swimming in a warm cloud).

They want to lower their cholesterol and reduce their risk of heart attacks and diabetes, they want to be HEALTHY! They want guidance from a Certified Nutrition Specialist, or Fully Prepared Meal Delivery. The biggest obstacles to losing weight are emotions and behavior, so we work with you to discover which habits are keeping you from being at optimal health. With us, health isn't a fad diet or the most rapid fat loss humanly possible. Health is a thing for life.
Our Specialist in Nutrition and Habits:
Create accountability, goals, and benchmarks to keep you motivated
Work with you to identify negative eating behavior 
Uncover what triggers you to make unhealthy choices
And with proven techniques, modify your behavior so that you automatically make health a habit!","Los Angeles, CA 90211",5.0,"Trainers,Nutritionists",LifeBoostFit,7,5,,7/16/2018,"After having reached a certain age, I was forced to accept that I needed to make changes in both my eating and exercise habits.  Rising glucose, increasing bad cholesterol along with increasing aches and pains in my back and legs - my doctor told me to lose weight and change my eating habits if I didn't want to suffer from even worse health problems.  I've tried all the various and sundry diets with names that are all too familiar.  I've experienced the madness of the 24-hour type gyms, switched to the ever-popular circuit gyms and even shelled out big money for smaller gyms with a trainer there to assist.  None helped me achieve my goals or allowed for long-term solutions.  I'm just not motivated enough to exercise on my own and have a great work out; I need guidance, counseling and encouragement. The answer for me is Tibor and his team at Life Boost Fitness.  It's a work out to be sure, but it is exercise my way based on my needs, my body type and what I like to do.  Much of the time that I've spent with Tibor is about life beyond just the traditional work out.  He has continually monitored my eating habits and gently guided me in a better nutritional direction. It's not a ""diet"" that is being recommended but a way for me to eat fully with recommendations for cooking at home and eating out.  I've received great assistance in coming up with things that I can cook over the weekend and take to work with me to eat for lunch.   There has been counseling for how much sleep I get, how to manage stress and how I can both set and achieve real goals.  It would be inaccurate to say that Life Boost Fitness has just provided me with a personal trainer for exercise, instead, it's a personalized 360 healthy lifestyle plan with my own coach standing beside me every step of the way.  I've changed for the better and I've become a healthier person through Life Boost Fitness.",5WNoIjpkigkgaUzJgmtJyA,Matthew H.,90211

The lady who helped me pick out the crystals I wanted was very knowledgeable on what the different crystals do so I could choose what I wanted and what I needed. I ended up mixing three different crystals into my mix and I wish I could hold it in my hand all day. Just picking it up changes my energy. I wish they were closer as I would try some of their classes but hopefully I will see them next year and most likely will see what else is available through their web site. Thank you for being so positive and loving with my husband and I. You help change the world and add so much positive light into an otherwise darkening world.

I've gotten many wraps in different salons and this isn't the most effective but if you know what to do it will help you detox and temporarily loose water weight: do AT LEAST three wraps spaced a couple days apart, drinking a TON of water, eating clean green and fiber, sleep, and exercise consistently during that week and those extra inches will definitely go down after the three+ wraps where normally you might hold it (arms and love handles). It comes back after a couple days but you've efficiently detoxed and will be glowing. This sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people think a body wrap is a magical blanket to loose pounds.

Some of my clients love workouts outside, swimming workouts, Cycling, Hikes, Circuit training, I really believe in keeping clients programs interesting and not always in a Gym. 
The biggest difference you will find is accessibility outside of our sessions. Clients are welcome to txt or call anytime with questions on food (i'm a certified nutritionist) or their training programs. 
I send articles to my clients based on the goals they are pursuing and why we are working a certain way. I really want my clients to become as informed as possible so that they feel confident in what they are doing and more importantly why.

Whether it would be preparation or intense skill training for a dance audition, TV & Film, fashion recommendations for an upcoming dance performance recital, or offering knowledge in the entertainment industry.  He conducts himself professionally at all times. This evidently shows how much he's serious of his craft and how eager he is to share his knowledge from his experiences thru out his career.

This is simple, practical, brutally effective self-defense, NOT MMA or sport fighting.  Many techniques that I teach would be illegal in a sporting match.

Whatever you do, take this class. I cannot recommend this class or company enough. I'm still talking and thinking about the class and we took it almost a month ago. Another reviewer said this class gives you a false sense of safety because now you think you can beat up anyone. I couldn't disagree more. In no world do I think I can get myself out of any situation, but suddenly, I have a lot more choices than I thought I did. This class made me realize how women (I know men have issues with men, but I'm a woman, so I'm coming at it from my perspective) are rarely rude to men we don't want contact from. We smile, we walk away (which is always preferable in a dangerous situation, so don't think they teach you to not get away), we sometimes don't listen to our gut instinct and intuition and that is was it actually dangerous. It is okay for my daughter to be rude (and get into the ready position) if some guy asks her for directions and then starts on about how beautiful she is, how old are you, all that crap we've all had to listen to all these years of being women. It teaches you how to USE YOUR VOICE! I hope I never have to use the skills they taught me, but at least I have them now. Also, I recommend reading the book, ""The Gift of Fear"" by Gavin DeBecker. Empower yourself, empower your daughters and sons. Even though only my daughter took the class with me, I came home and told my 10 year old about it and gave him some thoughts on if a stranger approaches him, etc. It opens up a dialogue with your children and that is so important! It was sobering when my daughter said to me, ""I've never once been rude to a guy who has tried to talk to me while walking, or at a store"" etc. And, that is crazy. She gets hit on all the time by adult men and she is 14. Take this class. Trust your instincts. Stop being polite (that's me talking). Talk with your children - male and female. Teach them what is appropriate and what is not right. I cannot tell you how much I loved this class.",FRAaSv1NMzxWXqjenEgIgg,Rachel Q.,90093

Born and raised in Southern California, Dino is the youngest of ten children.

People, you shouldn't feel offended when someone tries to correct you on how to do something. Of course, I understand there are ways  to approach someone about it, but know they are trying to help you! Anyway, it wasn't over YET! I told him my problem area. He then put me to WORK!!! My core and glutes were on FIRE! Not only did I have an EFFECTIVE workout, but I learned different ways to active those areas. Throughout the process I could see how knowledgeable and passionate he is about what does. The guy knows what he is doing! If you are looking for someone to train with, look no further.

His passion is evident in his serious approach to training his clients. He is mindful of old injuries and sincere when it comes to helping people train with the correct form as not to create new injuries. I have been a client of his for three months now and I am so impressed. I had almost given up on getting rid of my belly fat and toning my core. I had tried everything....except for HOF that is!! I can happily say that 3 months of Dino's fitness program and nutritional counseling and I have lost INCHES off of my waist!! I am so excited for summer so I can finally wear a two piece bathing suit again! (It's been a long time) Training with him is not for the weak or easily offended. He is straight forward and ambitious when it comes to his routines but he will give you a full body work out without any fancy gym equipment....and he won't let you give up either. He changes up the exercise routines so your muscles are continually challenged giving you the results you have been craving. I wasn't able to achieve these results on my own so thank you Dino and HOF!!,F34r0stmEgsYdHG9YZisnA,Michele B.,90045

He really cares and will go above and beyond for his clients.  In all the times I've worked out with him (and that's A LOT) I have never done the same workout routine twice...

I'm always laughing in between whatever set we are doing. And it's so creative, I never get bored or feel like I'm ""working out"". It's more like having fun with other parents & neighbors. I'm not a person that has ever lifted weights and I don't run, but somehow I'm able to without even thinking about it and I was inspired to sign up for a 10k with the group. Now, I'm suddenly inspired to wake up super early and jog each morning. Before Boot Camp, I could barely lift my kid above my head. But my 4-year-old asked me to lift him to the top of the basketball hoop so he could shoot a basket the other day and it was effortless to lift him completely above my head. I have diastasis recti. When I mentioned it to Brooke she immediately gave me modifications and told me what I should be doing daily to heal. She helps you reach your individual goals. For me, being healthy, strong and fast enough to keep up with my kids is super important. And the community at FitHappensLA is like none other. Everyone is fun, welcoming and very supportive.

I found that he is one of the best Lap Band surgeons in California, so I made an appointment and met with Arsine whom I absolutely loved from the moment I met her. Then I met Dr. Davtyan and found him to be the perfect fit. Regardless of which weight loss surgery you get, it doesn't put you in the gym or make you eat right, you still have to do the work. That's one of the reasons I love Dr. Davtyan - He and the whole staff really care about their patients. There was one incident when I had gained a little weight back because I wasn't keeping up with my healthy eating habits and he made sure that I got back on track. I like that he and his staff won't let you fall through the cracks. His staff will call to check up on you because they care, they want to see and make sure you are keeping up healthy habits and have lasting results. Before the surgery I was 306 lbs and I have lost 130 lbs with the Lap Band, which I've kept off for over 4 years now!

There is always a warmth and connectedness with other yogis in the space that Karen Elaine creates. Her classes feel safe, fun, and challenging for both men and women alike(which is unique in many yoga classes), and would be perfect for anyone who likes to play, explore boundaries of movement, and be their authentic and curious selves. Karen's classes and retreats attract tremendous diversity of people from all walks of life and experiences with yoga. She can meet any student at any level they are at (including super advanced yogis and complete beginners!!) and get them safely/gracefully into shapes in the air that they never could have dreamed of, all while they full-belly-laugh the whole time! Karen is a talented guide who can show you how much you are really capable of.

In addition, he kept me accountable better than any other person ever has. Dare I say it... he made working out fun again. My friends and family started noticing the changes in my body after I started my journey with Dan. He made something that seemed impossible, very possible. For that, I am grateful.

This treatment has changed my life in all the best ways. Like many of us, I had slowly put on extra weight throughout the years. I knew I was unhappy and wanted to lose it, but didn't have the energy to start. Then I heard about Diennet and saw the results firsthand. From that moment on, it was a no-brainer. I wanted to feel good about myself again. I didn't want to spend the time hand selecting clothes that covered certain parts of my body, or hide from cameras anymore. Since starting the treatment, I've lost all the weight I've desired and then some. I comfortably fit into a pair of jeans I wore 10 years ago and I'm forced to go buy new pairs because all of mine are too big. As wonderful as the weight-loss is, my biggest joy has come from the hormonal balance that I've gained from Diennet. If you are a woman struggling with hormone imbalance, look no further!

A couple would come off but quickly returned.  Then I remembered this program and was pleasantly surprised to find it still around.  If a diet institute is around after 30 years they must be doing something right!  I contacted them and started back on the program.  After three weeks I had gained a pound.  NOT what I wanted.  I discussed this with Arthur and he told me that he would make sure we got on the right track.  At their expense they redid the formula.  After a week on this new blend I have more energy than I've had in a while and I've lost three pounds.  I highly recommend this program.,n6Z0bd3Z-0_gjykKnfg8Lg,Rosie M.,90212

I lost alot of weight up to my ideal weight fairly quickly and felt great afterwards, healthy and maintained my weight for a while. Decided to get back on the program recently, needing to lose a couple pounds for an event I will be attending end of this year. It has been about 3 months since I started this program again. I don't know if its the ""new formula"" they are using but I do notice the difference and it is definitely not as effective as the first time I took it in 2012. The first month, I did lose a couple of pounds but not alot... I was also exercising and eating a very healthy diet with gradual decrease in my calorie intake which I think helped with the weight loss. Addressed this issue with the institute about 2 months ago wanting to see if they could replace the pills I have left and higher my dosage. Was told they would inform the doctor, ask for his recommendation and let me know. No call back. Called back about a month ago, with some concerns of the symptoms I was having and the same problem that I wasn't losing any weight... The following month until now, I still ate healthy but stopped exercising and continued taking the pills. I haven't lost a single pound! Same thing, they told me they would ask for the doctor's recommendation and again, never followed up with me with an answer. Their customer service is crap.. They only text you to see if you want to ""re-order"".... They told me they could higher the dosage on my ""next batch"" but no.... I do NOT want to spend another $600+....... I only decided to come back to this program because I knew for a fact that it DOES work and was very effective, well DID work back then. I didn't lose the amount of weight that I wanted and just wasted my money. Definitely won't be coming back to this program ever again.",QoaoBQ1puW7-837bd7h99A,Hello K.,90212

According to Wikipedia, ""Watsu is a form of aquatic bodywork used for deep relaxation and passive aquatic therapy. Watsu is characterized by one-on-one sessions in which a practitioner or therapist gently cradles, moves, stretches, and massages a receiver in chest-deep warm water."" I had first experienced Watsu in Hawaii and it was such a wonderful, gentle and therapeutic way to experience stretching and massage that I wanted to follow up with a treatment in my own hometown. I was having a flare up of arthritis in my foot and it made my entire leg tighten and cramp up.  I could have sought out a traditional massage, but I really was seeking the peaceful relaxation of the water environment. Watsu has a type of nurturing intimacy that you don't find in traditional massage as the Watsu practitioner will actually cradle your body at times.  It's so soothing and womblike and I really needed some TLC to take me away from the pain I was experiencing. I've always been a water baby so being in the water is just an added element of soothing for me.  Watsu pools are generally heated to around body temp so they are very easy to relax in. Often they are salt water as well (so there's much less or no smell of chlorination). Aqua Care For Me is in the private backyard of owner Elina Root.  The backyard setting is very quiet and tranquil and there's a lot of greenery from trees, bamboo and plants.  The pool is impeccably clean.  There is also an onsite bathroom that is very clean and there is even a shower where you can rinse off after the session.  Elina spent time talking with me before the session to discuss why I was there and what I wanted to get out of the session and to explain any pains or medical issues I had.  I could tell right away that she was a caring and empathetic and supportive person and felt total trust to have her work with me in the water.  Elina has many props that are used to either float or safely sink parts of your body (like your legs) so that you stay very comfortable during the session.  She uses a wonderful neck pillow that cradles your head as you float.  I booked an hour session but next time would opt for a longer time because the experience is just so soothing and therapeutic I didn't want it to end! I left the session feeling much better and very soothed.  All the cramping and tightness in my leg went away. Even though the stretching is so gentle, it is very effective because we have so much more flexibility under the water.  In September 2015, Elina began offering Aquatic Exercise class at her pool and I immediately signed up for twice a week.  The class is 1 hour and is taught either by Allison or Elina.  We have so much fun in the water and it's an amazing workout. There's music playing and the time flies by so quickly! The water is usually around 90 plus so it is very comfortable to work out in.  We do a warm up and then get more vigorous and then stretch and often end the session with a 5 minute float which is heavenly.  I've quickly added a lot of muscle to my body and my posture has improved a lot because we engage our core with everything we do in the water.  My favorite part of class is the stretching because we have access to so much more flexibility under the water than we do on land.  All the props and equipment are provided. We actually use pool noodles for a lot of the exercises and it's amazing how versatile those pieces of foam are! I will never look at an innocuous pool noodle the same way again! The pool is mostly shallow, so even people who are afraid of the water have a large area to work out in without ever getting anywhere deep. If you have any physical issues or disabilities, Aqua Care For Me will find a way to help you in either a therapeutic way or towards being able to be active and exercise. I had not been able to exercise since March of 2015 because of arthritis and thanks to the classes, I'm getting active again!  Recently I had a flare up and could not move my left toe at all on the day of the class. If I was going to a gym, I would have had to stay home.  But because of the healing setting of the warm swimming pool, I was able to still go to class and Elina was able to modify exercises so that I could still participate.  If I could come up with just one word for Aqua Care For Me it would be HEALING. If you live with a chronic illness or disability, this is the safe place to experience movement and exercise.",rtv1R06SUzcHfC7GyvsDXA,Lydia M.,91411

We did the past life regression and he easily guided me right into old memories and emotions that I have forgotten! He started with memories from this life and it was like I was there again feeling the exact way I have felt when they took place. During the remembrance and retelling of the first positive memory I had the biggest smile on my face, I couldn't stop smiling if I had tried! Then he took me back younger and younger until I was in between lives. This place was pure peace and love. Then I got to choose a life that was calling my attention given our intention for the session. This memory was beautiful! I was able to see everything in detail and feel all the feelings I had experienced in that life! I saw my struggles and my growths. It helped clarify a lot of the same struggles I currently am experiencing in this life. I would sooooo recommend this to anyone needing clarity or healing in any area of your current life!! It helps connect dots that haven't been connected. Thank you so much Rishi!!!",ZyySQLpg9O9-oapjHMb6sA,Andrea N.,90028

It wasn't like another session I took in SF when I lived there that made me think that yoga was just not for me. Manuela said that Yoga is for everyone and it should be enjoyed and practiced in a manner that makes you feel good about practicing it. What I liked the most is that She took time and focused on the best approach for me. She made me escape the reality that I'm not that ""fit"" guy anymore and just being ok with just me. Breathing and focusing on on my senses and the energy that the universe provides you, is the compass to wellbeing. I recommend Manuela for all ages and sizes.

When we got close to the due date, she would sit with my husband and I and go over everything, from labor, to after the labor, to breastfeeding... I felt so comforted and it helped with all the anxiety. Once the baby was born she was there for hours to help me breastfeed and visited me 3 times while I was in the hospital. Once the baby was born she was such an incredible support system and really helped my husband and I get through the first few weeks (that are so incredibly difficult). She is amazing.

He does a really great job with making sure everyone is having a good time and that everyone has the moves down. It definitely is a good workout...I always feel it afterwards and I usually leave class drenched! The moves are easy to get the hang of (and that's saying something because I'm a little uncoordinated at times). But each class leaves an impression: I find myself doing some of the Zumba moves when I hear certain songs come on the radio haha. ,qXM7mguHq4uwfJWoFW1ozQ,Alana C.,90038

I've moved to London now and to this day I still can't find a zumba class as fun as his. I love his class because of his positive attitude, enthusiasm, sense of humour, and variety of songs. He is really full of energy and you can tell that he genuinely loves what he's doing.",xb3sWwqB5ZtEM5wZr2pnCQ,Wassa S.,90038

Sanchez,22,5,Hollywood,7/23/2015,"I've lived in the area for 2 1/2 years now and had been looking for a Zumba class that compared to that of the last studio I went to. I had seen great reviews for Michael's class but never got around to attending. Last week I was finally able to and I loved it. I'm very picky about instructors but Michael was energetic, friendly and fun. He was very welcoming and would check in with me when he saw me struggling. I actually enjoyed that it was a little harder than I anticipated (as I've taken boring and simple Zumba classes). You definitely get an amazing work out while having fun and the price for a class like this is also very reasonable. I'm definitely going to make this part of my weekly routine and my only regret is not having come to this class sooner!",pj9W4bchkGcFfm4qsSJZEQ,Mayela D.,90038

,6201 Hollywood Blvd,4.5,Cycling Classes,SoulCycle Hollywood,68,2,Hollywood,11/16/2019,"I took one SoulCycle class prior to this one in Culver City. From what I gather, all locations pack so many bikes in that when you're doing arms you collide with the person next to you. I was on the sidebar closest to the mirror and I had to hop over two bikes to get to mine -- that's how little space there is between bikes. It was soul survivor which I booked because I wanted an hour long workout. The class was a little under 45 min. There were two people on the podium which I didn't understand. One lady was silent but riding the whole time and the other one (Janet) was ""instructing"" and sometimes on the bike. The music was terrible. It was all a ""concert"" country and rock and one really slow song. They all were live versions I guess bc there was talking and clapping and cheering at the end of each song. No extra towels. They didn't focus on telling us when to take off or add resistance or how much to add or take off so it was a guessing game. The arms song was terrible and we were supposed to stop pedaling. All in all, I came in expecting a 60 min intense workout and it ended up being 35 min of actual bike work and 7 min on soley arms. Would've been better if the music was varied, some current stuff, edm, hip hop. Just all country and rock live songs did not pump me up at all. ",ZCnpDAEnmxsgPMx9HJwi_w,Brenna D.,90028

I got more than I bargained for with Michal -- from my initial consultation he told me he could get me doing things I never did even when I was younger and in great shape, including standing on my hands, which I always dreamed of doing but never thought I actually could. After working with Michal for seven months, twice a week, I can kick up to a handstand against a wall with consistency. I'm also more flexible than I have been in my entire life; I can hit yoga poses now that I never could even when I practiced martial arts. My upper-body and core strength are also at an all-time high. I honestly can't get over the progress. I should say I wouldn't have gotten so far so fast without doing my homework; I do flexibility exercises Michal has given me every day.

First of all let me say NEVER waste your time or money going here. My instructor Lori was more interested in herself. She was only concerned about showing off her choreography and talking about herself. This caused a concern for my safety as I haven't done Pilates in a few years. The other issue I have was I was grossly offended by the conversation happening between two instructors next to me. They were trying to figure out which eating disorder to choose. This highly offended me as I am a recovering anorexic. When I said something about how there conversation was disturbing and unprofessional, the taller of the two just rolled her eyes, turned her back and continued conversation. As this isn't enough the studio was FILTHY. As I looked down while doing an Elephant all I could see was hair, dead skin and who knows what.

I'm now 7 months pregnant with twins and the extra weight is really inhibiting regular exercise. I live for the 2 to 3 classes I attend weekly. You get in the pool and as you float on noodles you feel weightless. The pressure on joints are gone and you actually get to work your core and stretch out those pesky round ligaments that can make you miserable. Plus you get a workout. It is such a supportive environment and you're surrounded by other women who are in the same boat. I'm planning to keep taking classes right up until my doctor tells me to stop... and then I'll be back after to help recuperate. And Sue... she's the best!",OXkHKBCVyZE4h8ep7agg2g,Cassidy B.,90036

Both Sue and Patricia are excellent teachers with radiant healthy energy. My hips have become liberated and limber from the workouts. I have a defined center of balance and hold myself with dignity because of the work out. I relish the 'zen frog' pose which provides me with defined safe space both physically and mentally. Summoning zen frog in crowded situations has calmed and centered me. I like it that the classes are not crowded. The practice has helped me with emotional stress when I had no one to share what I was going through. It is also fun because I don't sweat and the water supports my the weight of my body which is definitely more limber and stronger as a result.

Not a lot of variety, same songs and dances every week. Also, they automatically withdraw for the next dance cycle kind of like at the gym, so if you don't want to go anymore you have to make sure not to miss the deadline to call and cancel.

I had to stop for personal reasons  but I really liked the people there and the training was awesome. It's a place that's not only about Karate but also about the consciousness behind it. That makes it a rare commodity in my eyes. I also have an old injury that needs special attention and the way Jason (the owner) handled it was great. I was surprised how he elegantly integrated a whole rehab plan into the training. Some of the reviews talk about bad customer service but I didn't make that experience at all, in fact the opposite seems true.

Seriously! I recently moved from San Diego to Koreatown and was searching for a Pilates studio so I could continue my work outs. After reviewing a plethora of studios that were either strictly personal sessions or just completely overpriced, I came across Club Pilates. (I was already familiar with the franchise as there are some in San Diego but none near where I lived.) I contacted the studio to inquire about the founder's rate discount that I had seen online that was available for the first 50 members. I spoke with Danielle who had, unfortunately, informed me that they had already reached capacity for the discount but I wasn't discouraged and still opted to book an intro class so I could learn more about the studio. Danielle called me a few days later to let me know that someone had dropped out of their founder's rate membership and offered me their spot. I was speechless! Not only did she go out of her way to think of me (a complete stranger) but I was now able to become a member of a studio near me at a discounted rate for life! Fast forward to now, I LOVE CLUB PILATES. They have a vast schedule with tons of options that accommodate any schedule. Their instructors are sweet but firm and make sure you are doing exercises correctly (shout out to Becky and Maddie). Plus, they're located adjacent to a Lassen's so if you're looking for an incentive to push yourself through a class, just focus on that amazing salad bar. Thank you Club Pilates and thank you Danielle for allowing me to be a part of something that truly helps me find my center.",o3s1IViGAcRq9KKh9DOxug,Taylor C.,90036

Been teaching me about this fitness life since five years ago and recently She got me back on track with fitness in the third trimester of pregnancy, I was letting myself go and sedentary for the most part, gestational diabetes, bad diet and all that. I'm so glad I had those last few months training with Gia, doing workouts and cardio to get me moving, eating healthy. She was even there when I went in labor! Pretty epic! Now looking back I did it for me and my baby girl and I can't thank her enough. Cant wait to get cleared and start training again and  proud of her for having a platform to help people during this pandemic! If she has openings I highly recommend you lock them in. Her virtual sessions are like having her there with you. She is good about correcting your form to make sure you don't get injured and you get the best workout so your time is well spent. Also I love that she puts a lot of emphasis on diet which is soooo important, will check in with what you're eating and drinking and I like how she explains what's happening in your body in a way that you can understand, she's a very good teacher. Gia is highly motivating and still approachable and not intimidating which is great for beginners and she is also tough and will push you, which is great for people that are athletic but just off track, and need coaching to help them level up. Im so grateful we met, Gia introduced me to a lifestyle of fitness and self care. I was athletic as a kid but as an adult I fell into crash dieting, didn't understand how things worked, always eating too little or too much and not truly taking care of myself so that I could feel good on the inside with some healthy goals in place. I like that Gia digs deep and focuses on the persons overall well being, mind, body and spirit and I'm positive that every person that has ever worked with her has felt an overall transformation. Having a trainer like her is so valuable and will add years to your life. Definitely worth the investment. She's the best at what she does and she makes it fun!!",ezeNR79AyHxrMRTW9UwG4g,Tiffany Y.,90266

After 2 elections/re-elections and 2 back to back campaigns, my health (physical and mental) and weight finally took the final beating. I had gained almost 20 pounds, I had severe back pain and had to stop running, and felt depressed, hopeless and lethargic. I blamed age, my lifestyle and stress for my ""inability"" to lose weight and eat healthy. Then I met Gia Fey. She had such an amazing spirit and energy and wasn't the typical ""fitness"" trainer one tends to encounter. She was about loving yourself first, educating yourself about nutrition and working out last (but hitting it hard when you do). I didn't know much about Gia or her approach to fitness but I knew her energy was infectious and she had a banging body, so I sent her an email that dripped in desperation and anxiety and I asked if she could help me. Not only did she say ""of course"" but she also said, your situation is not unique. She emphasized that I wasn't alone. We met and the transformation began. I've had my ups and downs. Being fit and healthy isn't just about being ""skinny"", it's also about your mind, body, and soul. I'll admit, this is probably much easier now since I don't have to keep a campaign lifestyle anymore, but I don't travel less, I don't spend less time focusing on helping others, and between all my ""jobs,"" I spend just as much time working as I did before. I'm almost where I want to be physically, but I'm already there mentally and emotionally and I have @bodybygia to thank. If you want something bad enough (or have reached the point of being sick and tired of being sick and tired), there isn't anything that can stop you.

Such high energy and enthusiasm, takes the time to learn everyone's name. This is what a boot camp class should be like. Also SUCH a good workout...like 1000X more intense than when I work out on my own. She has a combination of bootcamp and spinning. Also she corrects form, which is really important and I've worked out with other fitness instructors who don't do that. Also the price is super reasonable, there seems to be a nice camaraderie among the people going, all in all a great experience. Also great for people of all fitness levels  - she goes out of her way to make sure the class isnt intimidating.

I found it difficult to get motivated to head to my spin classes and because I'm a full time working mom, I didn't want to sacrifice even another hour outside the home & miss more time with my little girl.

Found Mobil fitness, reached out and immediately received a call from Joe who listened to my needs and paired me with an amazing woman near my house. She comes 2 to 3 times a week and I squeeze in spin on the weekends.

My husband can see the transformation has made me a happier mom and wife & the money is pretty much in line as if I hired a trainer at a gym, BUT those trainers don't come to your home.

"The Balance Method™ is a personal training & health program that focuses on three areas of our lives: Strength, Energy, and Soul. 
 
Strength - A targeted personal training program that works every muscle in your body. Through personal training, classes, boot camps, and/or group training, I take you through a metabolic workout that focuses on strength training, muscle endurance and fatigue, and core balance. You'll blast away the calories and start burning fat FAST.

Energy -  Energy is FOOD. As a personal trainer, I work with my clients and recommend healthy food combinations, how to properly fuel the body, and how to treat our bodies kindly through food.

Soul -  Finding your self-worth again is the foundation of my program. Many of us struggle with body image issues or a lack of self-worth. We train our way to finding your self-worth again through diet and exercise.

"The Balance Method™ is a personal training & health program that focuses on three areas of our lives: Strength, Energy, and Soul. 
 
Strength - A targeted personal training program that works every muscle in your body. Through personal training, classes, boot camps, and/or group training, I take you through a metabolic workout that focuses on strength training, muscle endurance and fatigue, and core balance. You'll blast away the calories and start burning fat FAST.

Energy -  Energy is FOOD. As a personal trainer, I work with my clients and recommend healthy food combinations, how to properly fuel the body, and how to treat our bodies kindly through food.

Soul -  Finding your self-worth again is the foundation of my program. Many of us struggle with body image issues or a lack of self-worth. We train our way to finding your self-worth again through diet and exercise.  When you love yourself you treat your body kindly and the benefits will spill over into all aspects of your life.","Hollywood, CA 90068",5.0,Trainers,The Balance Method,3,5,Hollywood,1/5/2011,"I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant getting a trainer since I don't like getting yelled at (that is what I honestly thought!) but I have realized that me going to the gym by myself I wasn't seeing any results (hmmm I wonder why??). I am more than happy that I have Becky as my trainer! She may look sweet but she is hardcore! Within 5 minutes of my session I was already sweating! She is intense and pushes you outside of your comfort zone! Every session with her, I am sore the next day and I love it! I know that I actually got a good work out!

I was in the midst of a big move while we were working together, so my stress levels were high, and my physical activity (other than packing boxes) was pretty low. She was present and really participated with me while I was working out, and she was extremely attuned to the details of my body mechanics, constantly adjusting me or the exercises for maximum benefit.

,7375 Melrose Ave,4.0,"Dance Studios,Recording,Rehearsal Studios",Playground LA,33,4,Fairfax,8/13/2019,Calling all dancers! The Playground LA is a great dance studio. I signed up on Classpass for the beginner beginner hip hop class with Nick Gilligan. I arrived exactly when the class was supposed to start but there was a huge line outside the door. The class before seemed to be running over so we waited about 10 mins or so before we were let inside. Once inside the dancing began! Nick led us through a quick warm up before going through the steps of the routine. The routine was fun although some parts I think a little advanced for an absolute beginner with not much dance background. The class was packed and finding a good spot where you could see the instructor was hard at times. However Nick did give opportunités for people in the back to switch with people in the front so they could have a chance to see him and themselves in the mirror. At the end of the class he gave some dancers the opportunity to do the routine in small groups with him videotaping.  It's was cool to see how some of the dancers picked up the routines effortlessly. I do believe there were a lot of intermediate/advanced dancers in this beginner class. We did end up going over in time so at least the class wasn't cut short Seinfeld we started a bit late. All in all I had a good experience at Playground LA and I'll definitely be back!,2mKyp3TKU2jt6DZwhIdxhA,Isabel B.,90046

How do you expect a beginner to learn all that in 60 minutes?! Keep those dances for intermediate and advance groups.

I recently competed in the Miss California USA pageant. I have competed in some pageants before and never really did that well. This time, I wanted to really give it a serious shot and thankfully I found Chic Secret to help guide me along the way. I worked one-on-one with Holly, who was so sweet, encouraging, and stern when I needed it. She whipped my butt into shape with a very customized diet and exercise routine, which surprisingly I enjoyed. I have never been a gym rat, but I found myself excited to do a fun workout or try a new healthy recipe. And I have always been nervous about interviews, but with all of the tips and mock practice, I sailed through it like a pro. Holly also helped me find the most killer wardrobe and gown for the pageant. Who knew the perfect dress was so hard to find? I felt incredible walking out on stage and I did much better than I ever have before, especially considering that this pageant was on a much larger scale. I may not have captured the crown, but I walked away with such a sense of pride and accomplishment. That is something that I am forever grateful for. This experience has enabled me to tackle my professional life with more confidence, poise, and determination. I feel set up for success after my time working with Chic Secret!",ZAtTy6y010JBWgnk1kDK2A,Jessie M.,90036

The experience brought me so much insight and peace as well as a very clear sense of issues I needed to work through with myself to get to a healthier place. I friend of mine recently had a healing with Shehera and she too had one of, if not the most incredible spiritual experience of her life. I HIGHLY recommend Shehera and her healing abilities. She is truly an angel and will bring so much peace to your life.",UzcqTEm_xlSJ2Ele9HKivg,Lindsay C.,90210

She was fighting multiple health issues including cancer, and the medicines she was prescribed would create as many problems as they 'solved.' After working with Shehara, her health began to improve dramatically.  The healing energy Shehara creates is palpable, and she teaches you not only how to aide in healing your dog on your own, but in all aspects, including diet which greatly changed our dog's health as well.  She may occasionally have flare-ups, but we now know how to deal with them, and our dog is the healthiest she's ever been, sans any negative medicine.  ",j9VQaDJnl1-fHUpeHg-hZg,Ali W.,90210

James has been my acupuncturist for the last two years and I can't imagine how I'd have gotten through without him. When I first started going to James, my brother had just died and I was experiencing terrible insomnia and mild depression. He immediately helped me begin to balance my emotions and calm my nervous system. Since then, he's helped me with chronic shoulder pain, back pain and even fixed long standing hormonal issues.

After making a appointment on the online scheduling and confirmed by him and sent in all my medical info, he tries to reschedule and tells me he had that day ""earmarked"" as a day off. Then why was I able to schedule an appointment on that day first of all. Second, he said if the next day was not possible he would go ahead and come in. I sent my medical info 5 pages, and arrived to the appointment to see an unmarked building with a tiny shady looking entrance and used the call button to page through, and find the name, without an answer. Then got a call on my phone from him, saying he wasn't there and he no longer accepts my insurance? Just to get out of an appointment?!!! I priorly expressed in our communication through email how much pain I was in, and how much I appreciate him still coming in because this was the only time I had available in the next few days. I rushed directly from work to get there completely exhausted and I told him when he finally called me back all this same stuff and he didn't even offer to make it right or do anything at all. He was not IN ANY WAY PROFESSIONAL AND ACTUALLY HUNG UP ON ME. I did not call back, I am actually grateful this happened because I would NEVER want someone like that proforming ANY type of healing on me or anyone else. I haven't actually looked into his creditials yet, but I'd be willing to bet this guy is pretty fraudulent. I've never been around a healer who hold treat a patient like that. Absolutely not doing it in a passionate nature or in my experience even a remotely professional one. For shame!!!
