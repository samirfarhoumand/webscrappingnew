There's a new employee that started working there some months ago I would say less than a year and is very unconscious when it comes to customer service his name is Ruben I've had some defective products which had nothing to do with the store and he insinuated that I was lying about the product  making up reasons to bring back the product and then get it swapped out for a new bottle. This was very insulting to me as I have been using these products for over 10 years I would say could be longer. So if the colors are or the taste is off I would expect a full exchange.  Ruben was steadfast telling me how the company was losing money because the package was open. Come to find out there's a new owner at this location both stores are separate now.   Ruben would not let me speak to anyone else about the issue and proceeded to tell me he was the manager and I had no other options. After calling the Santa Monica store I find out he is not a manager. And that the Santa Monica store has more liberal rules about taking defective products back. And they do not know who the new owner is or have contact with him. From this experience and how things have changed I would recommend that going to the Santa Monica store will be the better choice and that is the option I will take from now on.,s4dXFDUSuUtUrbwNTLKzNg,Steven O.,90292

Working with Lesley, my body did change quickly and I saw a huge difference in the way I photographed. But that was just the beginning. I continue to train with her, because we continue to get amazing results and most importantly, I always feel safe with Lesley. She's so clear in her instruction, it helps me focus so I can concentrate on my breath, my abs and movement, even if we're doing something I haven't done yet, or working on a new piece of equipment. I can tell that she's really paying attention not just to my overall journey with her, but also to where I am each moment. She tailors my sessions to my personal goals and though she plans in advance, is able to modify based on where I am on each particular day, to maximize my workout. Her energy is amazing and contagious! I even secretly do an extra little happy dance of joy on the days I have an audition right after my session, because I know I'm gonna bring that awesome energy with me. Working out with Lesley has not only changed the shape of my body, but the way I carry myself. When I work with her, I actually feel the changes in my body all week. Okay, last thing: Lesley's always raising the bar-continuing her own training, finding new techniques...which is awesome to have in an instructor. Plus it's totally inspiring.

The front of the space is a boutique while the back is a wellness center. The girl who was working up front was super friendly and informative, so we decided to give the wellness center a shot and booked an ""Ultimate Detox"" for the next morning. We showed up at about 9:50AM, which was about 10 minutes before our appointment, as instructed, but the store was locked. So we walked around a bit and returned. When we entered and said that we were there for our services, the woman said hello, but was not what I would call inviting or friendly. Since the weather had finally turned from days and days of rain to sunshine and blue skies, we decided to cut our services down from the two-hour ""Ultimate Detox"" to the 90-minute ""Detox to the Max"", the only difference being 30 minutes and no amethyst bio-mat session. Since there is no actual therapist involved in any of these treatments other than leading you to them so that you can lie or sit there, we did not think this would be much of a problem, but she seemed mildly annoyed, which, I guess, is sort of understandable. Anyways, she then led us back to the sauna area and closed the curtain with her only direction being that there were two towels and two robes hanging for us. I asked what we were supposed to do and she said, get undressed, so we did. We undressed in the dark and, guessing we were supposed to enter the sauna, groped our way into it for 30 minutes. The sauna was really nice and we got a good sweat going, only to find out that there was nowhere to rinse off afterwards, and were instead supposed to rinse off using iced wash cloths and then re-dress in our street clothes for the rest of the therapies. We made this work, but it is a good thing that we are such good friends because two people, drenched in sweat, toweling each other off with icy wash cloths in a 4'x6' curtained room was pretty intimate - thank goodness it was so dark! We then picked up the rest of our stuff and the lady returned to take me to my 30-minute migun massage table session (She did seem to be in better spirits at this point). This is a table on which you lie that massages you while listening to the sounds of rain and the ocean. It was nice and I could see using something like this if I owned it in my home, but would probably opt for a live massage therapist in the future so that they can focus on tight areas, etc, per your direction. After this, I went for an ion cleanse foot detox bath. This was something that we had both read about and knew was probably a scam, but wanted to give a try anyways. The odd thing is that they have this beautiful, relaxing candlelit room with a sofa when you enter the wellness area, but they put us out in the boutique area for the soak, which was not as relaxing and lacked the ambience of the wellness area. The results truly do look super gross, although I am not sure if it was produced by the machine itself or from my body detoxing. A very pleasant girl then looked at the colors and foam in the water basin to tell us what we had just detoxed (liver, gallbladder, etc). Regardless of whether this is legit, the foot soak was nice. Overall, the décor is really, really gorgeous and the boutique has a lot of really interesting, unique items, but I would not go back for detox services as it is just not my thing. Some suggestions would be cubbies to hold your personal items and somewhere to rinse off from the sauna. Additionally, for new clients, some better communication of what to expect and what was happening from the staff would be a major bonus. We literally did not know what was happening or what we were supposed to do almost the entire time - and when we asked questions of the woman in charge, it seemed like we were supposed to have known the answer already. Anyways, it was an interesting experience and was not super expensive ($65), so it could certainly have been worse, but I am not sure I would recommend it. On a side note, however, it seemed like their yoga classes in the back area would be amazing - and also their list of massage therapies (with a real therapist in a walled-in massage room) sounded promising.",2SKjlEJ7opY9Mk_DcI50Jw,Drew Z.,90291

I am autoimmune, diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and I binge. I tried different diets in the past; autoimmune paleo, paleo, keto, you name it. The end results were the same. I was always tired, always hungry, always depressed. I would fall into the same pattern. Depressed so I would binge. Then I would be depressed because I binged. Honestly, I felt not only physically weak but mentally. A friend of mine whom is studying to be an RD, suggested to see a nutritionist. She would constantly tell me it is an investment, but worth it. Money is tight for me. Why would I go and spend money to have someone tell me what to eat when I could go and spend that much money on food and feel better in the moment? I think that might have been my breaking point. I am in my early 30s, constantly fatigued, always having muscle pain, inflamed, breaking out in hives. Just miserable. When I contacted David by email to ask if he has had experience working with autoimmune individuals? When he stated he did, I took the plunge. I had my first consultation. Before meeting David, I kept thinking to myself how this was going to be a waste of money and my time. He won't be able to help me. I will admit, I was so wrong. I have never met someone who is so genuine. He really wants for you to succeed. I had a bad day here and there, but I kept pushing forward because David is really there for you. After figuring out what may have been causing my hives, rashes, inflammation, and body aches - I started to eliminate these foods. After 6 weeks of sticking to this new lifestyle (it was really hard!), I can say I actually have energy, less aches and pains, not as depressed as I was. At our last session he said, ""This is only the beginning."" He is absolutely right! If I feel this amazing after such a short term change, I cannot imagine how great I will feel in the long term. He truly saved me. I don't know if I will ever find a way to thank him, but everything he has done for me - I appreciate it and will never forget.",3Vez7-PCzwdjcc5NDn73_A,Nicole V.,90025

I had been to 4 different treatment centers and had been in therapy the whole time. David explained brain chemistry in a way that no ever had before, and I began to understand why I was engaging in eating disorders. It wasn't because of unmet emotional needs as I have been told by so many therapists, it was because of my diet mentality that led to restrained eating. Once I began to binge my animal brain learned this behavior, and it became habit. David helped me break the habit and stop dieting and now I am recovered. I no longer engage in eating disorder behaviors. I highly recommend David Wiss as a dietitian.",HR_OfX8Oo4mHi2eporhbIQ,Linda C.,90025

It never crossed my mind that my poor dietary habits were causing my depression. David explained to me that with his guidance, I would learn to eat in a way that would improve the ecology in my gut, which would improve my mood. I had no idea that gut bacteria mattered, I thought nutrition was just about calories. David challenged everything I know about nutrition and showed me a way to eat which changed my entire world. David worked closely with my therapist throughout the entire process. I am now two years sober, not taking any medications, and cooking most of my own food.

A co-worker suggested I contact David Wiss to get my eating patterns back to normal. I was sure he would just put me on another diet. David was gentle in his approach with me and suggested small changes each week. None of the guiding principles he taught me seemed impossible to do. He taught me to start trusting some of my internal cues around food and hunger. After 4 weeks I was on a rhythm which included a lot of variety. I've been using some of his recipes and easy snack ideas. I feel confident that I will never have to go on a diet again. I also fell in love with yoga.

I had successfully competed in a few bikini competitions, so I thought I knew how to exercise self-discipline, count calories, and kill myself in the gym for hours to lose weight. Nothing was working, and I came to David for a complete revolution in my thinking around and approach to food. We started off really slow (cooking and eating at home more often, eating breakfast, swapping out Diet Coke for water w/ chia seeds). David encouraged me to eat more (!!) and to eat a variety of whole foods. Four months later, even more important than the weight I've lost, is the hope I have for a new a long-term sustainable relationship with food. Summer is coming up and I have no desire to kill myself with a psycho diet, diuretics, or fat burners. David is very easy to talk with; always encouraging, never critical or judgmental. I looked forward to each of our sessions. In small, incremental doses, he gave me a ton of practical, helpful information I had never before considered.

I was hesitant to contact him because I thought he was going to put me on a strict diet. Instead, David took the first session to learn everything about me and started with only one or two tasks each week. The first week the only thing we changed was my beverage intake as it was made very clear to me that sugar-sweetened beverages affect my brain chemistry. Over the course of 4 weeks I was able to ween off the sugar! I no longer experience any cravings and the things I used to eat don't even appeal to me anymore. David taught me about so many delicious and simple food combinations and how to prepare snacks in advance which was so helpful! Of course, the by product was that I lost weight, but David taught me that there is so much more to nutrition than calories and weight.

There is always a warmth and connectedness with other yogis in the space that Karen Elaine creates. Her classes feel safe, fun, and challenging for both men and women alike(which is unique in many yoga classes), and would be perfect for anyone who likes to play, explore boundaries of movement, and be their authentic and curious selves. Karen's classes and retreats attract tremendous diversity of people from all walks of life and experiences with yoga. She can meet any student at any level they are at (including super advanced yogis and complete beginners!!) and get them safely/gracefully into shapes in the air that they never could have dreamed of, all while they full-belly-laugh the whole time! Karen is a talented guide who can show you how much you are really capable of.

Her music was also a good mash up of current and older songs that were all upbeat. What really surprised me today was the care they had for the riders.

Casey is very patient in analyzing your swing and really makes sure you understand the feel of how you should be swinging rather than getting overly technical. He gives you one or two key things to work on at each session which simplifies the process rather than overloading you on swing thoughts. I made my first birdie last week and looking forward to continue to work with him on my game!

Found a deal for Alonzo Martial Arts on Living Social and decided to try it out. Master Alonzo is great with kids, very funny and lots of fun for the kids, my son enjoyed going to class. I could only give 3 stars however because the focus just was not there. The technique he showed the kids was great but because the kids didn't want to miss out on the silly stuff Master Alonzo often did in class, it was a bit difficult for them to focus on what they were supposed to be doing. Silly stuff is great for the beginning and end of class to get the sillies out, then it should be focus and discipline during technique time.",Obp73Y3w12cVEqHZCB9Y1A,christal n.,90404

I went there 3x for my shoulder which was twisted in the accident. I exercise  daily which I've done for many years,   walk  daily 2-3 miles and I always  eat   a very healthy Mediterranean  diet.  I found the    few sessions   extremely painful and not helpful.  After  session  2, and 3   for several days I had   shooting pain in my arm,  shoulder,   tightness in my neck and back, and  some discomfort in my knee,  my husband and I  decided that  this isn't a  very good place  ,  and I should  quit before I got badly injured, or  needed more surgery from   damaging pt. Later on  when I'm  less  sensitive, then I'll go back to Kern  for some more therapy, Kern is a  thousand percent better.  Additionally the   therapist  would only work with me for about 30 minutes  very intensely maniupulating my shoulder, the pressure was far too firm, and then   for the next  30 minutes I'd  be sent off with an assistant while she worked with someone else, but not a Kern there I'd have the excellent  therapist for the full session.    At   Kern  the  manipulation  was very brief, and no so painful, the  therapist always went over  Pt exercises I was doing at home  to  check and tweak things which never happened there,  and always  additional  things would be added,  they were very careful   strengthen but  no  pull my body in weird ways, or   do things too hard  where I'd wind up with pain which happened  at   this  awful place. I had  to stop  the last  session early for    heat ,  I never had to do that at Kern, it was always the right amount of    exercise and pressure, it was   so helpful,  unlike this place.

Ryan's combination of exercise, meditation and personal guidance has been a lifesaver for me. He is intuitive, caring, patient, funny, engaging and challenging, and his approach to coaching helped me to deal with both my physical injury and the other areas of my life that also needed some attention. He was able to tailor each session on the fly and to my particular needs for that day/week.  Plus, he has great taste in music which made our time together feel more fun. Not only do I feel better overall, but I feel a renewed sense of self - mentally, emotionally and physically.

At first I was worried if we would be a good fit because he is in amazing shape and I thought he would push me too far, too soon. I have had this problem with other trainers, who don't listen to me or ask about my previous injuries. There is no question that Sam could give anyone the most intense and difficult workout ever, and those who are in perfect shape would be pushed even further by him. But that is not my situation. As a person in his 50s with a history of several injuries, I needed someone who could push me but not hurt me. In all honesty, I thought Sam must have had some medical training as he deeply understands the human physiology and how the body works. He consistently gives me the most creative, engaging, and interesting workouts that are customized to me. He absolutely pushes me and I get great results when I work out with Sam. The difference is that he is both brain and brawn--he is in incredible shape himself but also one of the most intelligent people I have encountered. He understands how to push but not to go too far, and he also knows how to build in recovery to the workout. With previous trainers, I would get pushed so hard that I couldn't walk for days afterwards. With Sam, his creative and insightful workouts are challenging but also work you out in ways that do not have lasting negative impact. This was extremely important for me. It is clear that Sam's own personal sense of integration and spiritual focus grounds his work as a trainer. He is a man that respects others and wants all of us to be the best version of ourselves.

What makes him even more of an amazingly ideal trainer, it is that at the end of the day, he takes pride in his work, and he makes you appreciate a great workout.

Additionally, we appreciate the feedback and accountability that he incorporates in his coaching. Equally important is the variety of exercises that he thoughtfully designs to match our progress.

My partner and I went from placing 6-8th in bronze american smooth so 1st in almost everything.  Lorena is the type of teacher that you can feel comfortable enough with to talk to and share your life stories.  She aims to get to know you as a person not just as a pupil.  If you need life advice, she has a plethora of knowledge.  Honest to god, everything that comes out of this wonderful woman's mouth is gold.  Lorena is a gift to the adult dance world and the world of teachers.  She won't use wishy washy abstract language, but will break complex topics into tangible, understandable items.  ",Pov6uUHK4l_B-KtZiR3BVA,Kim L.,90025

You do what you gotta do, friends). Aaron is the chillest, funniest, and most knowledgeable goob you could get for a trainer. Guy knows his stuff.

-New Guidelines-

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use. We will provide disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer to all members.",2306 Hyperion Ave,5.0,"Trainers,Boot Camps,Weight Loss,Centers",Velocity Boot Camp,35,5,Silver Lake,1/20/2020,"I was first introduced to Velocity Boot Camp in June, 2019 when I took a free one-week trial class. I had been looking for a gym to join, but wasn't sure ""boot camp"" was the right fit. I leaned more towards yoga and walking, but was open to something more rigorous that could provide resistance and strength training. Matt's class did not disappoint! I was sore for at least two weeks and cursed having to get up at 6:30am to get to the 7am class, but here I am - 7 months later - a devout fan & addict. I am healthier, stronger, and have more stamina. Those heavy, Costco-sized bags of dog food? No problem. I just toss 'em in my cart.  Matt is a super nice guy and has designed a challenging yet do-able program that delivers 100%.",bJ50cquUC_OYg81400zKXQ,Pamela T.,90027

I attended the breathwork and sound bath session last night and I feel like a brand new person. I was struggling with debilitating anxiety and panic attacks. In August I decided to try to take measures to understand where it was coming from, then make lifestyle changes in order to heal myself. I became vegan, started meditation twice a day, began seeing a therapist once a week, got my bloodwork done and began taking vitamins and supplements. I was fighting the good fight and definitely making progress but I felt there still were some missing pieces. The Universe worked it out perfectly because this class was recommended to me at the perfect time. Because of therapy, I knew the childhood traumas and life happenstances that were causing the anxiety. This gave me the opportunity to let it truly go last night. I was so nervous because the anxiety I had been feeling makes me sensitive to any small changes in my body, like increased heart rate, etc. In addition, because of some of the aspects of the trauma I had experienced, big crowds were difficult for me to navigate. But I listened to JP as he told me that I was safe and that he'd bring us through. I wanted and NEEDED the breakthrough. I fought through the fear for the first 10 minutes or so and then I  released it. I found my own power within me and it was so much stronger than the fear I'd been experiencing. I will never be able to express my gratitude for what this class was able to show me. I've already recommended it to several friends and family members and I'll definitely be back.

I know this sounds all touchy/feely, but it's much bigger than that.  I cried like I haven't in years and got to some deeper things I thought I had dealt with and also tapped into the fact that there is more to uncover.  He gets you to connect with your chewy center.  I took another breath work class and it was nice but it wasn't this.  Jon Paul talks you through your experience that makes it more powerful and lasting and gives a greater benefit.  I am recommending it to everyone I know because everyone needs this.  This work gets you to take a deeper look at what you are struggling with be it anger, grief, depression or just the confusion of being human.  He does his thing at a church in Santa Monica every Monday and it is the perfect space where you are surrounded with like minded people just trying to get better.  Simply put, this works. I have done many things for many years and this is so profound.  After one session I was sold.

As a serious yoga practitioner who recently recovered from injury, I was looking for a pilates studio to help with stability and strength that would help me build up my weakened muscles.  All of the teachers at Turning Point were phenomenal.  I knew a lot about the body but not much about Pilates, and through a combination of privates and classes, I learned a ton and gained exactly the stability I was looking for to feel more confident in my yoga practice and in life.  Pilates is now a core part of my routine, as I've learned so much from Robin, Roxanne, and the other teachers at Turning Point, and I realize how good it is for my body.  They also managed to accommodate my busy scheduled with a ton of flexility and options.  Thank you Turning Point for keeping me grounded and injury free!",-6VaV1j8EXXGdv-qxZXEzQ,Jillian F.,90066

Your messages are full and I sent a message through your website but I haven't heard back. I tried your intro class in November and chose to do yoga at a different studio. In January I noticed that you had charged me for two months of monthly classes. I called and spoke to the owner and she said she would take those months off and refund me the money. I checked my bank account yesterday and I see now that not only have I been billed  for December and January on my account but also February March April and May.  You are very kind people from my few encounters with you and I know that things slip through the cracks in small businesses. I'm super happy to take down my review I just need to be reimbursed for all of the months that I never signed up for yoga at your studio. Thank you,RJqoX610bhsDLLIQMcaD8g,Gigi H.,90401

I started practicing Kundalini Yoga in 2002. I did teach training in 2004 and taught for many years. However, my personal Kundalini Yoga practice became non existent for about 9 years (other than listening to and chanting mantras). I took a few classes here and there in cities I've lived in but really haven't focused on this aspect of my life. I recently moved to Santa Monica and a friend encouraged me to come take class at Kundalini Yoga by the Sea. First of all, the name is too cute for words. It felt really good to walk into a welcoming studio and see Yogi Bhajan on the wall and Sat Nam on the door. The class I took was excellent. It was a fairly challenging Kriya and meditation. The gong during savasana was wonderful. I signed up for the 40 days for $40. I can't wait to go back! Highly recommended.",G9i7IStQFSNZDRHgfoIqTg,Alexandra S.,90401

I would have said game changer, but it is my back that has truly received the benefits. I was seeking a reliable chiropractor I could feel comfortable with. I had a wonderful Chiropractor back in Chicago but since moving to LA, I had tried a few places but nothing stuck. I had the thought to call my trusty chiropractor back in Chicago to see if they could suggest someone in LA and to my surprise, my chiropractor of choice had also made the move to LA! I immediately tracked down Dustin Martinez to Whole Health Chiropractic and am now gladly making the trek from Weho to the West side. I have been suffering with low back pain for the last few years. and with just a few visits I can already feel the difference. Dustin suggested that I begin a regimen of Pilates to help strengthen my back. I had taken mat Pilates in a group class setting prior, but never a one on one session using ""transformers."" WOW! Again BACK CHANGER and my new obsession. I have now taken classes from two of Whole Health's instructors. I adored both instructors for different reasons. Ellsworth is amazing and is perfect for people who may have a background in Yoga. He utilizes almost a Vinyasa flow technique which I can really relate to. He is lovely to work with and has a very supportive tone of voice while making important corrections which can make all difference. With every exercise, while working one muscle you are stretching another which feels AMAZING! Such an enjoyable ""workout,"" If I could go everyday I would! The next instructor I have worked with is Stephanie. She is also great to work with. She has a more Classic Pilates approach. I feel like she would be a great person to work with if it is your first time trying these techniques out. She has a way of breaking down the movements and explaining what you should or should not be feeling. Again such an enjoyable hour long session. ",6g6sA31tA_uqZwS1Boe5XQ,Tristyn H.,90025

So uncool , It's a public place just like a school or office and people should shower before and after. LOL!  ",8Iipl38mGZqz6pNKD3urTA,Princess Heidy A.,90292

Also, my first time at Modo, I got through the whole class and had a great experience with the exception of the unwelcoming front desk person. Now this second time, front desk was nice, but I wasn't a fan of the teacher. My body felt more sensitive than usual and I couldn't take the heat. If I stayed in class until the end I think I would have fainted. So 30 minutes into a 45 minute class I decided to leave. (Yoga lesson one: listen to your body!) As I headed out the door, I let the teacher know out of courtesy that I didn't feel well and needed to get some air. The teacher said ""You can drink your water."" She then told me, ""We actually don't allow ins and outs, once the class has started because it's distracting."" I didn't take it personal whatsoever, but it made me think, what if it was a medical emergency? I'm new to regular yoga, about 8 months, and I've noticed that there are some Yogis that are pretentious especially in the Hot Yoga community. After the teacher told me that essentially I couldn't leave, I grabbed my things quietly and headed for the door. She told me, ""Thanks for trying."" I'm sure she's just trying her best and adhering to the policies there, but management or the owners should really look into changing that policy for situations when it's wise to break the rules, especially for the customer's safety.

I nice little touch is that she actually goes around and adjusts your form in which I feel like alot of places don't do enough of. Ultimately, Alice knows how to motivate and has a light hearted and pleasant way about herself that just keeps you coming back for more!",ahYGpNoHElf0bKa9Qv7q5A,Jackie S.,90405

Sometimes Kanani makes special plans outside of the class that everyone is welcome to attend, such as riding bikes or rollerblading the Venice boardwalk, grabbing breakfast after class, etc. It fosters a real sense of community!

I felt that I was in decent shape before joining her class a few years ago, but working out in the sand without shoes challenged me in a different way. I have gained strength in my legs and in my endurance from her beach workouts. My jogging ability has increased as well. She's motivating, challenging and always keeps it fun. We partner up for some exercises, and she always plays great tunes! She encourages her clients to workout at their own individual pace and gives everybody tips on form and is very encouraging and inspiring.

We even learned some swing and Latin along the way, as he's well-versed in and passionate about many forms of dance. Thomas is an incredibly generous instructor who pours his heart and love of dance into his students, and time spent with him was surely one of the most memorable and meaningful learning experiences of my life.",oTUbXAgBqk68Q4xssCZKww,Nicholas B.,90025

She offers you to observe the treatment with other clients to get an idea of NSA.  I took that chance and in that room, her waste basket had tissues overflowing, and the entire basket spilled over.  She picked up the soiled paper tissues with her bare hands and never sanitized her hands before touching her clients, who were lying on their backs.  It was disgusting and just poor conduct to say the least. During the observation time, after her clients left, she jumped right into pricing--pointing directly to the highest premium package. I definitely took mental note. I wanted to give her another chance despite all these warning signs, and I paid for the private consultation with her which is a hefty sum--my understanding is that it would underscore privacy and confidentiality.  It was not.  She had another client come in, and there was no private consultation.  She was treating me simultaneously while with the second client was in another room.  I was not informed before, during, and after this in fact was not a private session even though I am paying for that based on what I had bought.  She also mimicked the abruption of not answering questions as was done over the phone.  She seems really disorganized, not able to gather her thoughts and present her work and the client-chiropractor relationship in a healthy way. She does not know how to deliver her services well, and is impatient even initially.  Her lack of transparency of not informing me about another client would also be present in the private consultation is a big No-No.  It is dishonest.",QwBO0cFIP1j0_9AOskB5bg,M M.,90025

I've only done one class, which is the Booty Building with Sal, but she's fantastic -- encouraging, thorough, friendly. I don't want to say this is a true HIIT class because she emphasizes form and doing slow, precise reps vs. just running around like a chicken without a head (which is so much like other group classes I've been to, unfortunately). But don't think that this class is easy by any means -- I've left exhausted every time I've gone and just absolutely sore for DAYS. I even got my friend into it (hello, Angela V., if you see this), and she feels the same. Even if it's difficult, this class is fun & when I've gone by myself, I've had no problem partnering up with a stranger (as is necessary) or asking questions when I don't understand an exercise (or forget by the time I get to that station, lol). Sal also plays some great hip-hop during class which I prefer, and it really meant a lot to me that even after just one class, she remembered me and is so nice now that I go more regularly.

I'm a person who always put a lot of priority on my health. My diet is immaculate, I make sure I get my required sleep, and I'm somewhat physically active. Since I moved to LA a few years back however, I have not been good at staying physically active (it was so much easier when I lived in Norway and had easy access to the outdoors and didn't have to drive in never ending traffic to get to nature, which is where I prefer to go to be physically active). Add lots of hours at work and spent driving in LA traffic, and the amount of exercise I've gotten have been extremely limited. When I do go to the gym, I often feel clueless about what to do besides going on the elliptical and using some of the basic machines. It's uninspiring to me, and I don't feel motivated to go, particularly not after a hard day at work. I was so fortunate when I was contacted by Marc, who lived in the same neighborhood I did, and I was offered to try a session with him. I don't have the easiest schedule to accommodate, but Marc was able to find a time that worked for both us to meet up. I can't say enough great things about the sessions we have had so far, over the span of a few months. I've tried a few personal trainers in the past. They were somewhat helpful, I learned a couple of things, but I didn't learn much to utilize when I returned to the gym on my own. It also didn't feel like they personalized the workouts specifically for me, my fitness level, and my needs. With Marc, I have someone I feel truly cares about my progress, how much I get out of our sessions, and he works hard on teaching me skills I can utilize in between sessions to continue working on my fitness. He makes it seem simple, we go into the gym and he somehow always knows what my body needs that day, exactly how far to push me (I feel sore the next day, but not to the point where it's a handicap), and what muscles and skills need to be worked on. He is excellent at correcting me in a very kind and constructive way when improvements need to be made to the form and techniques I use. Some of these exercises I would never in a million year come up with, but they are pretty cool and often fun too, and he makes sure I do them correctly so I get the most benefit out of them. I love that he's always asking me what I want to accomplish from each session, how I feel that day, etc. It's so clear to me that Marc has an extensive background as a trainer, both through academic training and many years of experience as both a personal trainer, soccer coach, and yoga teacher.

That nervousness passed less than a minute in. Mia immediately made me feel like we were partners, and together we would stretch and strengthen my body with absolutely no judgement. I had such a good experience during the yoga session, that I signed up for the Yin class. I'm hooked! It's exactly what I need--relaxing stretches held for longer periods of time, that gently open muscles. The focus is gentle and meditative attention to any areas where there may be stress or tension. After the session I feel relaxed, but also energized, if that makes sense. Tension is released, I feel ""grateful"" to my body, and I sleep much better after the Yin class.

Dance Studio Rentals",1709 Stewart St,3.5,"Performing Arts,Dance Schools,Dance Studios",Westside School of Ballet,44,1,,6/4/2018,"I was classicly trained (Ceccheti Method) and I can tell you that although the training is decent, not great,  their policies are not. While they are in a rush to take your credit card and sign your child up, they are in absolutely no rush at all to respond to an email or let you know that you are committing to 10 MONTHS of payments. Thats right, even if your child decides after 6 months that ballet is not for them, as mine did, I am still paying out her contract. A cancellation fee, I understand, even a hefty one but I had to pay $330 after my daughter chose gymnastics over ballet, after attending for 6 months. When I emailed to inquire about my account, I was given NO RESPONSE. Three months later, after sending another email, they finally let me know that I would be done with all my payments. And in my opinion, if I'm paying you when my daughter is not in attendance, have the decency to respond to your paying clientele, especially when you are taking my money and not even having to train my daughter. I understand contracts as I have a small business, so I paid without the extra money without too much complaining. However, as I have attended their Nutcracker Performance and their Spring Performances for years. No longer. PARENTS BE WARNED ABOUT THE 10 MONTH COMMITMENT! They don't make enough effort to be upfront about the crazy commitment they are asking for (from a 7 year old). Six months, I get it, 10 months is ridiculous. Also... the people that attend Westside can be the worst LA has to offer. Plastic surgery (which is fine) everywhere accompanied by arrogance (which is not fine). I'm an LA native so when I consistently hear people namedropping in the dressing room about their Director x-husband or their pseudo-famous child too many times, I cringe. These are not the people I want my daughter around. Pretentious, Arrogant, Namedropping. There are many other studios that are more friendly, less arrogant with training that is just as good and with competent administrative skills. Also, there is NO PARKING. However, Paloma, at the front desk is lovely and sweet. If it was her studio, I'm sure it would be different. ",2fy9WGOeWkgf9pRlm4hDJg,Melanie W.,90404

After about 6 months of Pilates, I noticed I wasn't feeling my nerve damage as often anymore. Cut to 3 years later and I can honestly say Pilates has almost cured me of nerve damage. Something my surgeon said I'd have for life! The stretching, flexibility and strengthening of Pilates is exactly what I needed and it's been the best thing ever.

I incorporate my Masters in 2 energy healing arts with my brain/neuroscience research to create a powerful experience.  Crystals and energy mats are often utilized.   Specialities are: heart healing, narcissistic exposure recovery, and trauma release for a fresh start.  Vets with PTSD are a special interest of mine.  

Clients wear clothes and I work above the body, so personal boundaries and privacy are deeply respected.  I travel between CA, HI and LA.  Sessions are via video, beach, spa or house calls (case by case).  

I also offer thyroid health and autoimmune health coaching.  I developed an approach based on my my book and knowledge of the functional medicine approach to healing.  I am not a doctor, but a patient advocate.  Sessions are via video chat and range from $75 - $250+.  They include solid recommendations you can implement before our next session.  Forward progress and alleviation of symptoms is my goal.  My book will be released shortly.

Can't wait to meet you!  Let me know how I can help when you call.  Thanks.  Laura :)","Malibu, CA 90265",5.0,"Reiki,Health Retreats,Meditation Centers",Zen Babe Health,2,5,,2/24/2019,"I've owed this review. Let me start off and say, Laura is such a beautiful and welcoming soul. I've had the pleasure of meeting Laura during my time in New Orleans. I was instantly drawn to her energy and later learned she does reiki amongst other great things. I had done a group Reiki session with her and it was fantastic. I wanted to do a private session and let me TELL YOU. I was absolutely blown away of how powerful she is. The moment we started I felt like I was dropped in mid air and floating. The amount of energy that was released and new energy flowing in, is something I won't forget. I plan to do more sessions and was very thankful to have my significant other experience Laura's work, here in California. If you have ever doubted energy work for some reason, let me in advance tell you. You will not be disappointed. She is very equipped and knowledgeable in what she does. Allow yourself to be open and welcome this experience. Sometimes we may not see how much old energy we carry. Allow yourself to let go and manifest. I got more than a meditation session. Thank you Laura, I'm very excited to work with you again!",FKXHEH_iwG9jlPYCRYnvtQ,Izzy S.,90265

I'm now 7 months pregnant with twins and the extra weight is really inhibiting regular exercise. I live for the 2 to 3 classes I attend weekly. You get in the pool and as you float on noodles you feel weightless. The pressure on joints are gone and you actually get to work your core and stretch out those pesky round ligaments that can make you miserable. Plus you get a workout. It is such a supportive environment and you're surrounded by other women who are in the same boat.

Both Sue and Patricia are excellent teachers with radiant healthy energy. My hips have become liberated and limber from the workouts. I have a defined center of balance and hold myself with dignity because of the work out. I relish the 'zen frog' pose which provides me with defined safe space both physically and mentally. Summoning zen frog in crowded situations has calmed and centered me. I like it that the classes are not crowded. The practice has helped me with emotional stress when I had no one to share what I was going through. It is also fun because I don't sweat and the water supports my the weight of my body which is definitely more limber and stronger as a result. H2Yoga has been a real blessing and has improved the quality of my life. Thank you.,KsP4rk3u2HfV6UlhLsn5_Q,Jane E.,90036

,2110 Corinth Ave,4.0,Martial Arts,Sawtelle Judo Dojo,8,1,Sawtelle,8/12/2015,"Came here twice in 2009. First in January and then August. There was no structure and a good number of students had bad attitudes. The Japanese Americans here have very bad attitudes and were not very welcoming. First, when I started there in January of 2009 there was no structure. They had no beginner class and I was thrown in the mix. I wasn't thrilled about that, but I played along. They didn't even have the time to teach you how to roll or breakfall, which is fundamental to judo. Why they would overlook this is beyond me. They had me working with higher belts, brown and black. I wrestled in high school, did a bit of juijitsu 20 years ago so I could hold my own if I have to. The students at Sawtelle were MMA wannabes. I lost a tooth because one guy sucker punched me out of anger because he couldn't submit me. The main instructors said nothing. But, the instructors got angry when I scissored a brown belts neck. They took me aside and scolded me as if I was a child. (note to sawtelle, I think a student punching another student and knocking out his tooth is far more scold worthy and worth removal from dojo). Second, the money issue. When I returned during the last week of August there were three days left until September. They tried to charge me for the whole month of August and refused to prorate it. When I pointed out that there were three days left in the month their response was ""So what, you want to train here you pay."" I left and never returned. I have a muslim friend who tried to enroll here within the past year and he was treated in a very discourteous and discriminatory manner. He told me he also just walked out.

However, this is not what we got by bringing our kid to this place. The person in charge tried to humiliate our 7 year-old in front of everyone by demoting him to a white belt because he was tightening his belt differently. This is not right, to humiliate a kid in order to make him stronger or to achieve anything. There are many other honest options that could have been explored.

"Los Angeles Wellness Institute (LAWI), located in Marina Del Rey, California, is a one-of-a-kind integrated wellness center that brings together both western and natural medicine for maximum benefits and the best possible patient outcomes.
Co-founded by Dr. Michael Billauer, DC, and Marci Reiss, DSW, LCSW, the Los Angeles Wellness Institute was designed to address the areas of health and wellness that are often hardest to treat, including pain, depression and anxiety, concussion, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), nutrition, and weight management.

They evaluate each patient to identify their unique challenges to health and wellness and create individualized treatment approaches to optimize their well-being.
Patients facing acute or chronic illness, pain, or other challenging physical or mental health conditions need help to get well. Generally, they have two options: they can choose western medicine, or they can use more natural approaches. Unfortunately, those two approaches rarely intersect.

Dr. Billauer and Dr. Reiss believe that there is tremendous value to be gained from combining western and natural medicine in the care of patients. They evaluate each patient to identify their unique challenges to health and wellness and create individualized treatment approaches to optimize their well-being.
Patients facing acute or chronic illness, pain, or other challenging physical or mental health conditions need help to get well. Generally, they have two options: they can choose western medicine, or they can use more natural approaches. Unfortunately, those two approaches rarely intersect.

Michael is an AMAZING chiropractor. I felt a difference in just one session. He is pretty honest about his work. I am so happy with his work. that I even recommend him to others. He treats patients like family. I am so thankful to have found someone who is honest and great at being a chiropractor. I read other reviews about how he has advertisements in his office and so on. Yes, is true but it depends how you see it, I see it as information and something to read while you wait. The therapy sessions are done in an open environment meaning others get to see which I think is a good thing because that way others can observe and people can't lie about being touched in a disrespectful way.

But I am very petite and had difficulty carrying the board from the truck to the water using just the carry handle in one hand. I ended up lagging behind and dragging my board until another person from class came back to help me. This felt awkward and not empowering. The instructor seemed to have an attitude of everyone is responsible for their own board. I wish they would've gone over different carrying techniques for tiny people. I think if there was some kind of strap available to disperse the weight it would be very easy to carry because the weight itself wasn't so bad it was just sized awkwardly for my proportions. It seems like bad form over the long run to carry stuff like this in one hand (like a suitcase) anyway. Wish there was more of an emphasis on good form with carrying techniques and evenly distributing weight through both arms. Otherwise, the experience was really nice once I got in the water. The board was very stable on the water. The yoga taught was balanced and refreshing.  Got some really good pictures!  I would glance at the water quality before you go, sometimes it is really bad at Mother's Beach, goes from A to F at different times of the year.",XHOl0xy6X-H1NBmhtV19Nw,Jo S.,90292

But my instructors kept telling us (me) to not look at our (my) feet, so I tried to staring into my partner's eyes...and did so with a furrowed brows and a piercing gaze because I was concentrating deeply on what my feet were doing. A happy medium was achieved: I kept laser-like focus on the chest area of my partners. I did this because I was able to concentrate on my feet at the bottom of my peripheral vision, while also monitoring and occasionally making eye contact with my partner. However, it took much time before I realized that the center of my focus was on every partner's chest area and when I did realize this, I was terribly embarrassed.

I met her in a group Akashic Records reading about a month ago, and I felt compelled to work with her one-on-one. As a healer myself, I am very picky about who I open up to, but I felt immediately comforted by her. She literally radiates unconditional love. She has an unique ability to help you tap in to your own spiritual nature and see an elevated perspective about whatever situation you are trying to process/heal. Plus the energy that comes through is incredibly transformative. I love to record our sessions and listen back to them later since there are so many gems of wisdom, and again the energy is so healing. She helps you make sense of the crazy world we live in and how to find your place and your joy in this world. She transmutes so much so effortlessly, it's really a gift of you are processing any sort of trauma or emotional heaviness, or even if you just feel stuck. Last week I was at a breaking point in my relationship and ready to give up, we just couldn't communicate in a healthy way. Daniela did a couple's reading for us and we were able to finally see each other's perspective as well as a spiritual one. I noticed the changes in myself and my partner immediately, and since then it's felt like we're back in the honeymoon phase, but with a deeper understanding of why we are in each other's lives and what we can each bring to the relationship.

I attended a salsa class tonight with my friend that happens to be female. We learned the basics for about 20 mins then Laura asked to get with a partner. Clearly I went over to my friend so we can dance together. Laura walks up to us and loudly asks ""Are you leading?"" I responded with ""sure"" she then turned and said there are plenty of gentlemen for you to dance with. I said ""no I came here with her and would like her to be my partner. We are gender neutral"" she responded loudly ""NOT HERE WE ARE NOT!"" and made a scene. Once I was clearly upset, she then wanted to say it's because it's harder to lead and that's why she asked. She claimed that she had no problem with women dancing together. There was clearly a problem! My friend and I left right after she made the scene with still an hour left in the class. I felt embarrassed, discriminated against, and disgusted with the way Laura handled this situation. I shouldn't have been put on the spot because I am a woman that simply wanted to dance with another woman. If I felt as disgusted as I did while not actually being in a romantic relationship with my friend, I don't even want to begin to imagine what a real couple of the same sex or gender may have felt. Steer clear! There is already so much negativity in this world and there is no reason for it to be in a place of free expression through dance.",tZOTeXosPGrvbSGmTHcWLQ,Amy L.,90066

My experience: The building is in a great location in Santa Monica with ample parking. Very clean inside and has a professional setup. Justin Stotts, from the Santa Monica location, is a professionally, highly-skilled instructor that easily identified key areas of my golf swing that needed improvement. He did not lecture but made our conversations more personable and engaging so it was easier to understand and apply. Now the cool feature is after the instruction you get access to your videos online from the GOLFTEC Clubhouse (website). You can use this as a base and reference it when you videotape yourself at the range or golf course. Now to be transparent, this is not a cheap experience so pay for the evaluation first and then add on from there if you can afford it. My only regret is not doing this sooner.

Marc specifically worked with me on performance related goals that I was able to put to use in the determined time that I wanted.

As a guy, I have to admit that going into this I had this preconceived notion that this ""yoga class"" wouldn't be very challenging....but I have to admit that the Yoga Sculpt class will kick your butt! The exercises themselves are not very difficult on their own but when done for an hour straight in a room that is 90 degrees, it really is a great workout. The classes are pretty intense and it will take a while to build up the endurance to do the entire hour without taking breaks here and there - so don't get discouraged. The thing that I like so much about this workout is that even though you worked your butt off for the entire hour, you don't really feel too sore the next day - so you can easily come back to the next day for another round.

However the Westwood studio has a problem. First the hygiene in the men's locker room is substandard. I've had to complain about mold in the showers, urinals covered in dust and pubic hair - reeking of piss. Gas station bathrooms are cleaner. My biggest gripe came last week. I noticed that the ceiling of the studio was open, exposing the fiberglass insulation. People who work with fiberglass wear ventilation masks, but I'm expected to take deep breaths knowing there are fiberglass particles blowing around the room?! I called CPY HQ when I got out of the class to let them know, and got a disappointing response. Kind of a ""I'll pass along your complaint, but that's really not my department"" attitude. I was sure they'd seal it up, so I went again a few days later - Nope! Studio management still exposing teachers and students to fiberglass insulation. So I walked out and called again to complain. This time the CPY rep was much more empathetic and I naively thought that they would make sure it was taken care of - Nope! Anyway, here I am writing this negative review as a last resort. I am hoping the Westwood studio reads this and fixes what looks to me like an easy fix. Just re-seal the ceiling tile so your students aren't exposing themselves to potentially toxic fiberglass particles.",IJq3dvjGJHoXVHRp_zibIQ,Brett D.,90024

The instructor, Jisun Kim was really personable, professional, knowledgeable, and attentive to every student in the class. Before class started, she introduced herself to all of the newcomers and asked if they had any injuries and checked in with them to see if they were new to Pilates. Throughout the class, she'd give adjustments or modifications to anyone that needed them. The workout was great. I was pretty sore the next day. I've taken other Pilates classes at other studios and sometimes I feel like the workouts are either too easy (feels like I didn't even workout) or too intense. I'm all for intensity and getting results, but just as long as you're not compromising your safety. I did a Lagree method exercise at a studio in the West LA area last year, and I ended up injuring myself (and unfortunately it's an injury that has caused me chronic tightness in that area). I literally pulled my hip flexor because I wasn't well versed in the movements. It was my first time doing Lagree. I also felt like the instructor there wasn't attentive and was just going through the motions. I can definitely see myself continuing to attend classes here. Currently I use ClassPass. I'm going to aim going here at least 3 times a week. I'm excited to see some results! Oh, and I had no issues with my hip during class!

I am a total health NERD and have worked with several coaches in the past, but Amanda is truly a cut above. She combines a holistic approach with tried-and-true fitness experience. She gave me the confidence to lift heavy in the gym while cleaning up my diet (in a way that NEVER left me feeling deprived--she's all about intuitive eating and delicious, health-boosting fats :) I've built muscle, leaned out, and solved some annoying gut issues along the way. Even during a pandemic--she wouldn't let me quit! I'm very grateful, recommend her guidance to anyone who wants to build lasting habits.",tivhoo6dFarlI-aSi0GFFQ,Kelsey L.,90039

If you're on the fence about a trainer, go with her! I tried other trainers before, and they do the same thing with every client. Amanda tailors your workouts so you can benefit the most.

I can't stand to give bad reviews and you can look at my account to verify this because even when we get the worst service I try and atleast give them 3 stars thinking it was an off day but for this place there should be no stars. First let me say it was impossible to find parking as it is at her house and there is no where to park so after walking 2.5 blocks that was the start of my visit and then she ask me to remove my shoes yet her floor is nastier than the street outside. She seems to have a problem with religion as she ask me to remove my necklace and she ask the same thing if my friend who is catholic and wears a miraculous medal everyday all day of her life as well as my cross for me. She does not massage nor do any Rolfing as she advertises. We both made Apts for Rolfing and instead the lady Ann makes you get undressed in a very cluttered and unclean room and then has you lay on a massage table where she lays her hand in you and holds them on your skin for about 20 mins per place then ask you to put your clothes on and then charges you 300.00. This lady in my opinion is a crook! She also has animals running all over the place. I felt like I should not have had to pay fo her laying her hands on my skin it was super weird. I ask my friend and basically her story was the same. I would go anywhere else but here because this woman will not help you at all and she is mean and rude! She also cut the apt short but it felt like she was doing some cult type experience on you cause she lays her hands on you like she is a healer but hates anything religious you may wear and has you remove it. No healing happened btw and I could have had my husband or a friend lay there hands in my body while I lay down for free...wouldn't recommend and I bet she doesn't get repeat customers because someone good would have good reviews and more than just one that's prob fake js horrific experience I would run anywhere else but this place you will be very dissatisfied and feel like you just through 300.00 in the wind,WiCeSM-8m7MT8Wiz0n8Uww,Piper V.,90025

They clearly used minimal budget for this new facility. The customer service of corepower in general is terrible. It really feels like a sharky culture where they really try to hook you and trick you into your membership. On top of that the class schedule is not variant enough. Every M-F class at 6am is yoga sculpt, never corepower yoga. I personally hate the yoga sculpt class so I could never do class before work. I recently tried to cancel my membership but was late and instead of being nice about it even though I have not been to class since my renewal they absolutely refuse to give me a refund even though I told them the morning schedule does not work for my schedule. Pretty shitty experience over all.",ajfMKqTCLNtFnCUNe6UV0A,Rosey A.,90292

It definitely exceeded my expectations. In only a 90 minute session they both gave me plenty to work on with my swing. I'm actually excited to go hit the range now - I've always hated the range. I'm definitely an amateur and not looking to invest a lot of money in my game at the moment - and I was glad they didn't push me to take a bigger package. We just got absolutely as much done as we could in 90 minutes. Thanks fellas.,qtBo9TB0-0Z3egVsoIQtlw,Alex W.,90064

So I cut down on certain things (certainly not drinking or drugging - I WAS unemployed, I needed to do something!). One of those things was getting my eyebrows waxed. Instead I had my best friend pluck them for me, because Lord knows I can't do anything for myself. She saw these wax strips in the store and thought it would be a good idea to try them. On me. I ended up looking like I ate it on my skateboard and fell face first into the boardwalk. I had little patches of hair in certain places on my eyebrows - and huge burns on other places. I couldn't go out for an entire week without sunglasses. Big sunglasses. And they weren't ""in"" back then. When my skin healed up enough that I thought it could stand to be touched again, I went back to the woman who usually waxed my eyebrows. She looked at me and screamed ""Oh my God. What you do?"" and I told her and she said ""No, you do nothing on your own. You come here. You don't touch your face."" She was right. ",3h352DEsa-HgjkN2FJsSiA,Suge K.,90401

She is completely unassuming and a wealth of knowledge, but mostly she takes the time to individually figure out her patients' issues and remedy them.  I will continue to see her after birth and for any other issues that come up down the road.",h7uldWt-xIQDS-e1Wgypvw,Tina A.,90066

She is kind, incredibly knowledgeable, and really makes you feel comfortable as she has such a warm personality and a great bedside manner. I made amazing progress during the couple of months that I was under her care, and when she discharged me, she gave me a clear plan that I could continue on my own.

If you are a skeptic just as I was about holistic healing, the power it carries, and the strength it gives you to go on living, then you are on the right review. I was, as many of you that is reading this review was very skeptical and hesitant about moving forward. But I kind of had my back to the wall. I was going through personal trials and tribulations. I could not fall a sleep for 3 nights. My body was aching and hurting all over, both on the outside and even more on the inside. I tried all kinds of over counter sleeping aids and no matter how many pills I took, nothing worked. I was going nuts. I felt like I was going to die. A friend of mine kept nagging me to go see Irena and how blessed I am for making this leap of faith and scheduling a healing Reiki session with Irena. She diligently worked for 2 hrs on me. At the end, right after we concluded our session, I was tired, but I felt so much better!!! It is as if enormous weight got lifted off my chest and shoulders. I am so thankful to Irena for helping me. I will be grateful to Irena for the rest of my life, and it seems like I only tapped into only a small part of the vast knowledge which Irena possesses in helping me go through my transformation process in order to live a happy, fulfilling life. There is so much more I can say about how amazing Irena is and the miracles she can perform for you, but I tell you, from one skeptic to another, what do you have to loose at this point in your life? All you have to do is at least keep a little door to your heart and mind open, and dial Irena right this moment and schedule a private session. You can write a thank you review to me later ))).",su3Jp8Pl9srjgOlbj0o46Q,Vadim D.,91011

If you need individual attention you will definitely get it here! I've been dancing with the troupe for five years and once you are advanced enough you are allowed to do solos.

First off, I'm not someone who's athletic and therefore have never been drawn to working out, particularly since I never felt I was good at it.  For years I struggled with consistency around working out. I would get really down on myself for not doing things perfectly or missing a day or two and then just stop working out all together. When I first contacted Amy (almost a year ago now!) she asked for us to meet before we started working together.  She took the time to learn more about what had and had not worked for me in the past, which none of my previous trainers have done.  She used everything I told her to completely tailor my training just for me. She has never put me down when I've struggled with any particular exercise and in fact only encouraged me or adjusted the exercise until I was strong enough to do what I initially couldn't.  She's warm, compassionate, professional, knowledgeable, flexible, punctual (we meet at 6am!), funny, and I could go on and on.

What I love about dancing with Toni is that her movement is so flowing (you can tell that she's danced her whole life). Ang lambot ang katawan. Her tenacity to teach and learn with her students of the process of decolonization of the mind and body is evident in her craft. She often rehearses with telling you the origin of the dance and movement making every dance intentional to its ancestral being. Her expertise of dancing Hula and Filipinx dances invigorates her craft as she has created a space where she can start every class with intentional medication guided with Hawaiian chanting and still represent her Filipinx roots by calling out to her family's origin. She is a patient choreographer and facilitator that is able to communicate how to improve your craft and also, ultimately wants you to improve not only your physical health, but especially your spiritual and mental health. She has advanced traditional movements and put her own twist. Toni has an impeccable resume of dance and even holds a Masters degree dedicated to her craft. You can assure that in any class she teaches will always be meaningful and a life changing experience that goes beyond-to just perform. Her heart is in respecting tradition and deviating from decolonization that awakens every chakra and leaves you in a good mind space following every class by ending with cool downs and meditation with intention.

They give you the option to be on a waitlist but I rarely get a call with an opening . I came for pregnancy related back pain and Caitlin was my therapist initially and she was great. A few times after I saw other therapists but seemed to have worsening pain after treatment . I don't know if that's a coincidence or not but per my ob's orders I was told to take a few weeks off from physical therapy . I came to reschedule after over a month and I was told Caitlin didn't have any upcoming appointments and if I were to come in , I would have to start with an initial assessment all over and get a referral again from my doctor. I also found out that even though I provided both my PPO insurance cards , they were billing just toward my primary even though my secondary had better coverage/out of pocket cost for physical therapy . I asked if they were able to backbill my appointments to the secondary insurance and they said no and that it is considered fraud.

Nothing seemed to stick until I saw Martina and her team. They worked with me from my very weak and unstable beginnings as any exertion caused pain. What is different about them is that they work with you adapting to your needs versus having a one size fits all plan. They are non-judgmental, there is no ego involved as you can tell they are just coming from a place of love. Also, Martina is incredibly intuitive and thoughtful and her therapists and aides are not only super supportive but give great game changing cues. I've learned a ton from all of them! It's a very friendly environment, even with the front desk staff with Erika leading the charge.

I've been to many of the other popular Barre studios in LA, and I think the Bar Method is probably the most dance-centric and most thorough. Here are some of the reasons I like this studio 1) their classes are longer than most studios at 60 minutes and class often run over to be 65 minutes 2) their carpet and mats are super super soft and comfortable to stretch out on. A lot of studios use floor + yoga mat or a much less soft carpet 3) the room is spacious and unobstructed. Some studios are L shaped or have pillars in the middle of the room 4) I like that at Bar Method the instructor always learns your name before class. Some people don't like that the instructor comes by to correct you and call you out on the mic. But they're doing it so you do things correctly and I much much rather they do that than not. Some people find that it's too harsh or embarrassing esp for newbies, but I think it has helped me a lot 5) I like the size of their ball, which is bigger than most studio's but that's definitely just personal preference. I'm still new to barre but I've learned a lot. I'm a doctor in physical therapy and I can see why this is really great for a lot of people and I have learned a lot from it myself.

"Fitness. Yoga. Coaching.

Your outer world is a reflection of your inner world.

You are not your story - my philosophy is taking a step back, looking at the whole picture, taking responsibility of the things we CAN control, and letting go of the rest.

You are where you are for a reason. Let's learn the lessons we need to to learn from our pasts, identify exactly where we are in the Right Now, and become more self-aware in our intentional steps moving forward.

The way you can make an impact on the world around you is by becoming the truest version of yourself, one decision at a time.

The way you make better decisions is developing an ongoing ""toolbox"" you can pull from, and spending the time getting to know yourself.

The way you get to know yourself better is by approaching yourself, your relationships, and your life with innate curiosity, rather than judgement or ""knowing.""

I interviewed a number of personal trainers in my area because I wanted to see who was out there and who I thought would be my best fit in terms of getting past some road blocks I've continually hit in the gym. I liked Mario because he was the one that actually started calculating everything I said and he started educating me (and continues to still do so) on some things I've never really understood about our bodies. I grew up a competitive athlete, am a patient of two different chiropractors over the years and I go to a massage therapist. Over the years (I'm 43 now) I feel like my joints, or to be more specific, my shoulders and knees haven't felt like they can handle heavier weight resistance anymore. So I've been backing off thinking that at some point I'll be able to rebuild my strength and flexibility so I can start increasing the weight to be able to get to a point that actually challenges my muscles, again. I've just felt that my durability and/or stability and range of motion will never be the same compared to when I was at my peak performance as an athlete. Well I have to tell you, Mario introduced me to some new ideas/concepts that I have incorporated into my workouts and I'm doing things in the gym, without pain or instability issues, that I haven't done in years. I've been working with Mario for a little over a month and I'm really impressed with his coaching style and the ideas and concepts he has brought to my attention. Every athlete, and especially every ex-athlete, should make the effort to meet with Mario. He focus's on specific and unique exercises/routines that help eliminate weird pains you may be experiencing and as a result certainly will increase range of motion, durability and stability. Over time you'll notice you'll be able to increase your weight resistance without worrying about injury and all the other benefits will fall in suit: shedding extra weight, shaping your physique and increasing muscular endurance etc. I've recommended Mario to the people I care about and I think you will find, and I'll say it again, that Mario is the real deal.

She is warm, thoughtful, and smart as a whip. I have seen her go the extra mile for her clients time and again. I routinely speak with Casie in a professional setting and she is always amazing me with her insightful and careful advice regarding the treatment of complex pelvic floor dysfunction such as, vulvodynia, chronic pelvic pain, erectile dysfunction, tissue disorders caused by hormonal imbalance, incontinence, and pregnancy/post partum issues.

Pelvic floor issues are scary, rarely discussed, and seemingly not understood by Western medicine. I went to Casie after being misdiagnosed by various different doctors and specialists. They repeatedly loaded me up with antibiotics, even though I showed no signs of infection. My issues and my pain were worsening, and the antibiotics were not helping. I was scared and alone, and felt I had no way out. Casie helped me understand what was actually causing my discomfort, and helped alleviate my pain through myofascial trigger point release and physical therapy exercises. She even referred me to an acupuncturist and helped pinpoint some digestive issues that were worsening my condition. I ended up having SIBO, which is what she guessed all along, and addressing this has been a crucial part in my recovery. Casie takes a very holistic approach to health, and addressing diet and stress has made not only a noticeable improvement in my condition, but in my overall well-being. Above all, Casie's compassion, charm and humor has helped me immeasurably throughout this process. Pelvic floor dysfunction is a sensitive and scary issue, but Casie made me feel so at ease during our sessions, even when I was at my worst and feeling my most vulnerable. I don't know where I'd be without her. I can't recommend Casie enough!",upm-5sTrnPthgIgB-7I7xQ,Andrew P.,90401

It's good that my husband and daughter could take the class at the same time. The schedule is very flexible and the price is reasonable.

Master Kim is inventive with his teaching style and pushes children and adults to believe in themselves and their abilities. My daughter, husband, and me currently attend his classes. For myself, not only am I physically stronger, I am emotionally stronger as well. There is something powerful you gain when you break a thick board with your foot, with the support of your fellow classmates, and the belief that you can do it - from a very experienced teacher. You get an amazing workout, the community of parents and fellow students are unbelievably supportive, caring, and kind, and most importantly, my daughter, who is 6 years old and currently brown belt - loves attending his classes. My husband recently was offered a great job out of state. He's partially chosen to commute so he may continue taking classes with Master Kim - so all of us may continue taking classes with Master Kim. We feel very fortunate to have found an experienced, dedicated, supportive, yet firm teacher - who believes children and adults are capable of a lot of things in Tae Kwon Do. He does have a heavy accent so he teaches by demonstrating, which is effective and inspirational. Do  your mind and body a favor and try his classes. Just show up - don't call. He's busy teaching, but he will certainly welcome your presence in the class!",irN8ImO7iSFPlta0fwLIRQ,Myung Jin K.,90064

I finally committed and started taking classes 7 weeks ago at Studio Maesto. I regret waiting so long because I am having so much fun. The beginner classes are for anyone who wants to learn. Zero experience required. Rodrigo breaks down the moves so it's not intimidating and it's actually really easy to learn. Classes are affordable and I have made some good friends since being there. Private classes are great excelling quickly and correcting bad habits. They always have fun parties and are very warm and welcoming. ,6oo-ahHbFn9th8KjD64lqA,Stephanie N.,90401

Her expertise seems endless and her skill set is not limited to conventional treatment methods. She possesses knowledge in visceral manipulation, craniosacral therapy, REDCORD NEURAC; these are a few I have experienced during our sessions.  I initially saw her for a neck pain. During treatment I shared my concern about my other ailments and she was able to help as well.  My neck pain was gone pretty quickly and I was provided with stretches, exercises and things to avoid for after the session. Dr Augius took time to explain specific exercises and answer all my questions. I am really happy that I could find a practitioner who treats the whole body not just a part that hurts; this is truly invaluable. I am forever grateful for her help and guidance.",K53x2q4D8oo1afPXU18Vgw,Natalya T.,90403

I thought I injured my neck by exercising too much and kickboxing without proper training. It turns out I had significant muscle and structural issues that had developed over several years (due to stress and terrible posture) and needed to be addressed. Dr. Augius figured out exactly how to help me. My treatments included a combination of Red Cord therapy, which helps to stimulate deep postural muscles, and Craniosacral therapy, which helps to calm the nervous system and free restrictions on the nervous tissue for increased function of the muscles and organs. Each treatment session also included exercises and stretches in the office, and Dr. Augius also sent me home with a ""workbook"" of nightly, targeted exercises and stretches to do at home to reinforce each session. Dr. Augius also helped me with breathing exercises which really help to quickly calm stress and help you feel more centered. Thanks to all of the above treatments and lots of PATIENCE (thank you Dr. A!), I feel a million times better. Dr. Augius educates you along the way, which I definitely appreciate. The road to healing is a journey and a process. I always recommend Dr. Augius to as many people as I can, she is truly amazing!",BtRoBXakuCPobZOMZhkiFA,April D.,90403

While treating the diagnosed issue, she noted that my lack of strength/flexibility in hip/lower core and postural alignment has been another cause of the extreme tension in the lower back and has been diligently addressing this. Using the Red Cord, ultrasound and specifically designed exercises she has helped me to awaken the muscles in the hip/lower core, not only leading to immediate short term improvement but long term comfort as well. Her style of explaining the issues as well as her calm and persistent attitude has been essential to working through treatment for this injury.I would highly recommend her for any-body related injury.",T-OIUHBjvsHKvURiFj4fAw,Scottie J.,90403

It was night and day.  I would joke to friends and family that Dr. Augius was a miracle worker...in just one session I started to feel better, and every week I continued to improve...was able to walk without pain, gain mobility back, and understand how to prevent future issues.  Not only is she top notch medically, she has an extremely warm + kind manner, she worked hard to fit me into her schedule, and consistently kept me top of mind with additional suggestions for healing or exercises I could try at home.

When I first started training with him I thought for sure I would have to see a nutritionist in tandem with a personal trainer, but that is not the case. He has been coaching me on my food intake - what to eat, how much, and how often. I feel energized, grounded, present, and happy working with Rhett. He is helping me get the lean, strong, feminine body I have always wanted. He created specific workouts and routines for my body which partnered with my diet have really helped my insomnia as well. I was so weak, ""skinny fat"", and used to only run on the treadmill. Rhett suggested a body spec test to be able create an individualized plan from the data.

After the first class, the instructor sits you down and asks you to pay $60 for more classes as a first time deal. Fine, I figured that was a deal and I wanted to give it a good chance. During the second class, he decided I wasn't stretching enough, so came over and pushed my foot down even though I told him to stop.

(don't take his classes) I originally bought a groupon of 10 kickboxing classes very excited since I've wanted to do this for years. I began paying an annual fee and pulled out once he started hitting on me, and I asked him to stop. Once I denied his passes he started ignoring me in class and acting out and treating me badly. I came back after a conversation we'd, had clearing the air then paid for a full year of unlimited package for $1000.00 of unlimited Kickboxing classes and 52 TRX as a package for a full year. Although I did start to see a difference I began noticing his lack of compassion toward mine and other injuries his clients have. It 's difficult to understand his broken English and his classes began to get repetitive due to his lack of interest. His tactic to teach class is for everyone to text him when you are coming in so if there aren't more then 2 people in the class he won't teach (which was not disclosed when I signed up and paid for unlimited). He makes you feel like dirt if you don't come in everyday yet won't teach if there are not enough people.   He'd make snide remarks about peoples weight and life style if they weren't like his.",F_CgHH7V1XOjN2PKVI7rGg,Deanna M.,90403

I love how Diana makes the hour go by so quickly, adds in lots of health tips about what to eat/what not to eat, and keeps the group laughing too. I am a fan of cardio, and she easily mixes in cardio sprints with weights and core toning exercises. It's an overall body workout that challenges, but doesn't exhaust.  If you want to find a motivating instructor and a fun group workout, try D Method. Diana rocks!

We tried out many shaft options but once we found the right shaft, the results were awesome. My shot dispersion got tighter with some extra distance! She explained very thoroughly why those shafts worked for me compared to the ones i have and others i tried out.

Jason at Club Champion was an excellent fitter to work with and made the experience great. I did a driver fitting, and was able to see how tons of combinations of heads and shafts worked best with my swing. He guided me through the logic behind his selections and the options he presented, and helped to explain the logic behind the process as well. There was no pressure to purchase, and he was very open about what other options would be best for my current skill level and golf goals.

I hit it well, and at that price, expected it to last.  However, after about 6 months of use, the shaft broke on hole 17 at Bali Hai, in Las Vegas.  I immediately contacted Club Champion, and they said send them pictures.  I did and they said Fujikara would not cover it, saying it was my fault.  I'm 65 years old and haven't misused or slammed clubs in over 10 years.  I am very disappointed that they wouldn't stand behind their product after charging so much. They did offer a token 20 percent discount off of MSRP,  Ping shaft works great with an unconditional warranty.  I don't think Fujikara or Club Champions are in the same class as Ping.  I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND EITHER for the price and the worthless warranty.",DhFHFEiOmfEGtpxnzWTtTQ,Stephen W.,90404

I now wish I had done this when I was young and could swing better. I was fitted for the whole bag but only purchased the irons and driver, a little bit of sticker shock. However after playing one round with them on real grass I had to go back and complete the set. I will play these clubs for quite sometime and considering the amount of money I have spent over the years on iron sets and the latest driver or 3 wood or hybrid, in my case I think it's well worth it........Well worth it!",iCfqtVVnZwXI5RUyzwtxPg,Mark M.,90404

There is definitely a sticker shock compared to going to a golf shop, but consider that they are making clubs specifically to fit your swing and the commitment that Club Champion stands behind their clubs and builds. I will never buy from somewhere else. The time and knowledge they give you and if you're willing, the information you get from this helps you so much to understand what happens in the swing and shot shape. Reason for the review now is that after 2 years I've made adjustments to my swing and wanted to go back and make sure that loft and lie were still in a good position and they did that for me no problem. Even found that my decision to change a grip from standard to midsize changed the weight balance of the club that was robbing me of distance.

I have been playing with the same set of clubs for over 10 years, and Jerry took the time to catch me up on the technological advances in modern clubs and shafts of which I had fairly little knowledge. I had a lot of questions and requests, but Jerry had answers to all of them. He had creative solutions to my many swing needs and requests, especially with the Driver as I wasn't initially comfortable with the looks of many of the modern drivers. Furthermore, Jerry and his team offer the option to sample every club head and shafts that I had asked for, including the Mizuno fli-hi that I had never seen elsewhere. Ultimately, he let me make my decisions, but he offered assistance and advice every step of the way. He gave me 2 hours overtime, and we geeked out on the topic of golf for 5 hours, and I was very appreciative of that. I'm happy to pay a premium to get the right clubs, and to ensure that I wouldn't have to keep tinkering with my bag for awhile. Overall, it was a fun and educating experience on golf at Club Champion, and I've learned more about my game and of course the clubs in my bag moving forward.

I still have the top with the hole in it, completely untouched since I could never get a reply from them on how to return it. Frustrating because now the season is probably over and the company probably doesn't have it in stock anymore. This really could have been prevented. When a customer points out a damaged item, and asks you to submit an order through a different store location so they can get a non-damaged version of the same item, it's just so inappropriate to send the same damaged item to them. It was also inappropriate for them to lie and say they submitted the order to a different store location and then clearly not submit the order to any location other than their own. Just lying and ridiculous. I don't like to have my time wasted over a silly top. Each time I returned to the store they acted like it was a hassle that I was back, but if they just did their job right the first time and took the sensor off the first time and gave me a non-used, non-damaged item then I wouldn't have ever been back at all.

Not only am I healthier and significantly closer to my fitness goals, but I have learned better coordination and focus.

I was training with adults, including professional fighters, and never felt unsafe. I found that there is the right mixture of respect and practicality at this school. You bow and connect with your partner before every drill. Yes the teachers can be hands off, but the experienced students help to guide the less experienced ones.  I felt totally taken care of through my teens, and when I went back after college.  Sure there are some visiting students who are a little too aggressive trying to make the most of their time.  But the JKD approach and the Inosanto approach involves a lot of learning from your peers.  The instructor is a guide, but you have to learn by doing.  In terms of crowded classes, yes it's unfortunate sometimes, but it's never impacted my experience adversely. Most classes only do light-touch sparring, hence the lack of shin guards. As a student you are expected to show restraint and respect to your fellow students. And that system works for me.",majr_bLX0vkQECRgeOv0aA,Henry M.,90292

Little lizards and tiny plastic toys that all immediately went into the mouth. They obviously had no idea what appropriate teachings tools were for small children. This place just wants your money and you have to pay upfront for everything in a group of ''sessions'. Truly a waste of money other than getting to hang out with my friends and their kids.

Needless to say I was skeptical and borderline hopeless that I'd ever feel back to normal again. I've been working for Deena for a few months now and cannot say how grateful I am to have found her! She has helped me minimize my inflammation and gain flexibility back and approached my issues not only from a physical standpoint but also from a dietary and mental/emotional perspective too. She tailors your ""homework"" to you personally as well as gives you tools to implement in your own time too.  She also could see me early mornings so I wouldn't have to miss any work for my weekly appointments with her! My condition has improved greatly and now I only see her once a month for management and tune-ups of my treatment plan. She is also incredibly warm and nurturing as well and her office staff is friendly and has been very communicative with scheduling and such. The only downside is my insurance doesn't cover her practice, and although I'm paying out-of-pocket, I feel that the expense has been worth it due to the quality of my care as opposed to bouncing around from doctor's office to doctor's office. She called me before I started treatment to discuss my symptoms as well as payment and disclosed the fact I wasn't covered upfront as well, so the charges didn't come as a surprise either.

I went to this studio for years and really enjoyed the classes and convenient location. I developed a Bakers Cyst in my knee and had to place my monthly membership on hold. I decided to get a class pass instead. I went back to this studio planning on using the class pass instead of starting up my membership again. When I went in I was given such attitude by the instructor behind the desk. She was rude and not friendly at all. You expect people in the yoga community (especially instructors) to have a kind air about them. Oh well Core Power has lost me.  Good thing I have a class pass I'll find the right places for me now.  Im only interested in working out with kind friendly like-minded people. 10:30am 3/27/2019,8fdnk0mQURtIPtCul4Vfaw,Sunshine G.,90025

Try Ayurveda!
Ayurveda (pronounced ""eye+ur+vay+duh) is a holistic system of medicine from India that incorporates the body, mind and consciousness when evaluating disease. It is the sister-science to yoga and the two are used hand in hand to resolve physical, emotional and energetic imbalances.

Integrating the principles of ayurveda, yoga, and meditation I will custom design a wellness plan to achieve your goals. Energetic imbalances often manifest as undiagnosable symptoms. If left unchecked, these may worsen and eventually manifest into disease. Using a holistic, supportive approach, I target the root cause to address energetic imbalances that are causing your symptoms (stress, anxiety, migraines, bloating, constipation, sinus congestion, lethargy, emotional eating, tinnitus, acne, anger, insomnia, ADHD, etc.). I integrate holistic practices (diet, detox, meditation, yoga) to support individuals with cancer and chronic illnesses. Always encouraging, I keep you focused on positive changes.

Food as Medicine: 
Hire me to prepare seasonally fresh whole foods for you or your family that will nourish your body and feed your soul. More than a chef, I am a wellness provider using food as my medium. 

Corporate Stress Reduction and Wellness Programs:
Stress is the leading cause of sickness resulting in lost productivity and declining revenues for companies.

Robert utilizes his research and experiences as an LMFT in discussing many 21st century parenting problems: entitlement, power struggles, and perhaps most pressing: technology. Robert is very knowledgeable when it comes to the many ways that screen time, video games, and phone usage can impact our children's development. His knowledge is not limited to ""what studies say"", though he is very well-versed in that arena. Rather, his understanding of these problems (and real-world solutions) comes from the frontlines. His extensive work with parents and children has informed his expertise, making him an incredible resource for struggling families and parents trying to incorporate best-practices for screen-time, parent-child dynamics, and optimal childhood development. He is a parent himself, which only adds to his passion and understanding when speaking to other parents. Robert is great in front of an audience. His style is informal and open to continuous questions. He will allow the group to steer the discussion while remaining on message.

The story is:  I made an appointment as i had a groupon which i had to cancel 6 hr before appt due to some health issues. She has informed me that they have 24 hours cancellation policy, so im gonna loose all groupon value.  I was never informed abt that before.  Though she said the cancellation policy indicated on groupon, however i double checked everywhere and it is not there.  Neither i was informed when was calling and doing appointment,neither i was informed abt it in text message confirming my appointment.  basically they said nothing about their cancellation policy. After i have explained all the above, she said that i would have to assume that it is 24 hr cancellation policy as similar business have same policies and they don't have to inform their clients abt that, or i should've read their website to learn about it. Confirmation text message was a courtesy so basically they did me a favor by sending it. There was more she said but didn't make much sence but just an excuse why they are not willing to do any exception on it, but they can only provide me with 20% of discount for my next visit but im loosing whole value of expired groupon. not only their manager is unprofessional but i view it as a direct violation of consumer rights",2Xdh5kBPbbXB0loN1U5LMw,Louise A.,90405

My son is now 3 1/2, but I attempted to put him in swim 2 years ago (I was in the pool with him the whole time) with Kidswim. He literally screamed the entire time the first 2 classes. It was super stressful and unproductive. When I let Kidswim know, they offered to refund me the money I paid and suggested I wait until he was ready. This made it obvious to me that this company really has a child's best interest at heart and isn't in it for the money. 2 years later, I felt my son was ready to learn how to swim and I looked at other schools like Philswimz and Swim to Me, but decided their method wasn't a good fit for my son and my parenting style. I contacted Kidswim and I liked that their philosophy is really based on teaching children HOW to swim (and breathe correctly) and not just survival swim. I signed him up, and his teacher Javon is wonderful. Shes playful with my son, and moves at his speed. She has a great warm and positive attitude and is very affectionate. She recognizes that my son is playful and energetic and uses that to motivate him to gain new skills, like going after water toys and acting like a shark. I would highly recommend Kidswim to anyone who wants a great swim school who works with your child's personality and development.",4z-wxAm7PhkT_b0-oTvdhg,Jaimie Z.,90066

I've been a member of several different private gyms in the past with limited success. The trainers at the gyms weren't really into it, they had the same workout/meal plan for everyone, couldn't provide much in the way of how everything worked together or mods to the plan and when the clock struck 1 hr...that's it. I can tell you, PerFitness are NOT those trainers! From the moment I met Michael, he was all about me hitting my goals. First, he wanted to know what I REALLY wanted to achieve...was it fat loss, physique, bodybuilding, getting stronger. From there it was finding my starting point both with my exercise and meals, then we pressed forward. Typically on a meal plan, I'm either hungry or just hating life, with PerFitnes all meal plans are tailored specifically for me and adjusted where needed to make my goals.

One hour with Coach Cedrick is like 3 gym sessions in one. For real. I have cancelled all my gym memberships so I can train 1:1 with him. Every training session is different so he leaves you guessing and it's dynamic and back to back adrenaline rush. You start with functioning training, hard core cycles with little breaks in between, then it's HIIT plus pad work and a ton of Core and Strength. At the end of every session, you feel 200% satisfied but also know and feel humbled by how much you still need to improve. And Coach Cedrick works with you on that. He pushes you to your limits and past them so you know what you can handle and it's mind over matter. He makes you stronger each time. Im a fitness snob. 2 marathons. 1 triathlon. And run and train myself independently. But when you're with Coach Cedrick, it's a whole different level.

So when my wife went in for her last surgery I decided to mix things up and have Kurt train me because I was getting stale and needed a new regiment in my training.

The teacher I had was teaching level 4 but the person who took me said he was level 1-2. I now have a foot injury that will take 2-3 weeks to heal and I can barely walk. The teacher was pushing everyone really hard - which is fine. But the move was very dangerous and shouldn't be taught unless there is a tremendous amount of practice and preparation. I would not use this teacher again but that doesn't reflect on the studio. The teacher was skilled but unaware of possible injuries with the move he was teaching - and that is irresponsible.

She has the best energy and made it clear that this wasn't about how well you did the moves but the overall experience. In the middle of the class she called me out for doing well and I was so impressed that she knew my name. She came around and helped adjust each move of the participant.

I also create diet plans and educate my clients on nutritional principles that prove essential in reaching their goals.",828 N La Brea Ave,5.0,Trainers,Eric Janicki Fitness,20,5,Hollywood,9/6/2017,"Eric is by far the best trainer I've had.  I'm a slow gainer, despite consistent workouts and sincere efforts, and he gets RESULTS the others have not been able to get.  He knows his stuff about the body, diet, and everything that goes into making improvements to your body, and makes it all healthy and fun.  For being such an amazing fitness model and competitive bodybuilder, he's very sweet and welcoming, so don't be intimidated by his amazing photos! His workouts are informed by science to get you results by science.  He encourages and motivates like no one else, and not in a barky way, but in an encouraging way that's tailored to who you are and what you want to achieve, and gets you past old limits.  I consider him well worth the investment of time, energy, and money, and I know you will, too!",Ne-b0S4sVxfPGEMiJEAkeg,K.
