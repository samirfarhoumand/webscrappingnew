Their service is very detailed to your needs, they provide: towels,  gym clothes, and everything from  body lotion, hair dryer, comb, and hangers in the lockers. They just recently upgraded their sauna to steam one and I must say that's the best perk in this gym compared to others around k-town area. The only downside is the fact their membership is a bit on the pricy end, but the benefits definitely pay off if you make the effort to use the membership consistently.

The programming is as good as it gets - challenging, fun, and varied. All of the coaches are extremely supportive and really get to know each member. They quickly recognize each person's strengths and weaknesses, personality, limitations, and emotional capacity, and they know how to push us beyond what we ever thought possible without breaking us.

Looked at a few training gyms throughout the westside and was not impressed by the packed shared facilities, setup or pricing. So glad I came across Kekoa Fitness! In the six months I've been going my strength and overall fitness has improved immensely! Rick is truly an expert and knows exactly how to design a workout regiment based on your needs. He's very detail oriented and makes sure you are using the right technique, unlike some other trainers I've had, which has made a huge difference. You can tell Rick, and Gary as well, really enjoy their work, care about their clients, and are truly happy when you make progress in your fitness goals. Rick is always positive and goes the extra mile to make sure you're also eating right and taking the right protein/nutritional supplements. He knows when you come in if haven't been eating correctly/following the nutritional plan haha. I actually look forward to going to workout! 90% of the time it's like having your own personal gym with just you and a trainer, unlike other facilities I've gone to or seen where you're sharing space and equipment with a ton of other people. It's very personalized. Honestly Kekoa Fitness is the best thing I've come across in LA so far. I highly recommend if you're looking to dedicate yourself to train and get in shape.

I literally moved from Las Vegas to train with him at Mansion Fitness. No regrets! In my youth I was an athlete, so I expected Mansion Fitness to be like every other gym to which I have belonged. However, when I walked into Mansion Fitness my first thought was, ""Holy Smokes!"" The equipment is top notch, the wallpaper is the Haunted Mansion level of cool, and you can't beat the chandeliers. The seating area has super comfy wingback chairs in which I quite enjoy sitting before my sessions with Rodiney. During my sessions, I must say that the music selection is upbeat and fun. Many times while resting between weight circuits, Rodiney and I have danced around like a couple of chipmunks. The environment is conducive to such frivolity. Since clients here work with personal trainers it's not crowded or distracting and even when we need to wait for a machine because it's popular that day, there are plenty of more types to choose from which satisfy another part of my training. The machines are well-maintained and clean. The shower room is well-stocked and clean as are the bathrooms. The lockers are convenient and are located on both the top and bottom floors. The fact is, I come 3 hours one way on a bus and train to get to Mansion Fitness and so I bring a stuffed backpack of necessities; it easily fits in the lockers so that is a huge plus! Lastly, I have to say I walked in thinking that such a classy establishment would harbor elitist staff. I found this to not be the case. The front desk staff are quite friendly and cheery and I've chatted with a few in house trainers while waiting for Rodiney to finish with an early client and have found them to be equally friendly and easygoing. Overall my experience at Mansion Fitness has been very positive and I recommend them to anyone who wants to enjoy their time at the gym as I have thus far.",xussYYBykfHhpIdSBsGI_Q,Maureen J.,90069

I've been coming out of a somewhat of a depression and just got myself to drag myself back to the gym. Then the pandemic hit and all the gyms closed - so did mine. There was literally no way to get a workout done and FTA's online program was a life saver. The exercise program is done almost exclusively with bodyweight without any equipment needed. It was really hard for me in the beginning (besides leg day since I'm an Ultra Runner) but it gets ""easier"" from one session to the next, even though easier does not necessarily mean it hurts less but I can feel my strength improving from day to day. As if that's not enough, I also signed up for a 28 Day Detox program. After all, you are what you eat. The recipes are delicious and easy to follow. It focuses on portion control and the right combination of food in general. I was able to lose 15 lbs while not starving and with just 1 hour exercise per day. The program is truly amazing and I would have not know what to do with myself if it wouldn't be for this program, especially during this pandemic. It helped me to stay calm and focused. Vanessa is usually the one that follows up and makes sure that everything is going well and suggests little adjustments here or there as not one of us is the same. I highly recommend this program for anyone that wants to shred a few pounds or just want to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Thank You GUYS, you are AMAZING!",iraV2ApOtMbMzHAjAVOgnA,Michael K.,90034

They also organize a social calendar that keeps all of the members engaged and feeling like a family. Most members have been here for 2+ years. They keep their place clean, have two bathrooms, and a really nice shower (bring your own towel). I've never felt so confident at a new gym and new extremely unfamiliar workouts.

The staff is great and they do an amazing job of tailoring the workout to your ability level. The environment is very friendly and encouraging. I would love to rate this place 5 stars, but unfortunately they pulled a serious dick move. When I injured my ankle recently, they refused to put my membership on pause.  When you sign up, they tell you that you can pause your membership at any time for $50. This is a lie. They offered to pause my membership on March 1st (I made the request at the beginning of February) basically telling me I had no choice but to wave goodbye to the money I had already paid for the month of February. It's bad enough that they charge you $50 to pause a membership, but they then restrict your ability to pause it to only one day per month, and then they lie to you about it when you sign up. This is a really shitty way to treat your customers. And it's really sad because I love all the people who work there, and I would love to recommend this place to others.

Sure it's intimidating to start something new, and with all of the barbells being thrown around, and lots of terminology, and people who look AMAZING and perform even better....it can feel isolating (like one review said), but that's just called starting something new! I was probably one of the most scared to ever be a beginner, this was my first box, and everyone there was so supportive. I humbly and appreciatively call them all friends now! I've had to attend a few other boxes with a job that has taken me outside of Hollywood and little did I know how much I had lucked put having CFHW as my newbie box! After having experienced a few other boxes, I've realized a few things unique to this place. The programming is OUTSTANDING. Fun and results driven which is a hard line to follow. The energy of the members, in my humble opinion, is unmatched and so, SO motivating. The coaches. Enough said. They rock. All of them. So technically sound and personally invested. I love this place. Can't WAIT until a show puts me back in Hollywood so I can come back!  And a minor point, the dues are competitive with boxes of the similar caliber and location. It's crossfit.

My weight fluctuated between 130 and 135lbs. Since training with Tony I have gained 15lbs of lean muscle and a lot more core definition. He takes the time to make sure you are excicuting each exercise correctly and explains why your form is important for which muscles are being used. I see Tony 3 times a week and when I work out on my own I now have a MUCH better understanding of how to workout each muscle with every different exercise, even the ones i've never done with him. I would recommend him to anyone not only to push your limits and achieve your goals, but also to educate you on properly doing these exercises. It's important to learn from a professional so you don't injure yourself or just simply waste your time working out incorrectly. ",lyrdo_2JByxV0oDpyPjOAg,Trevor Dayn D.,90038

What I appreciate the most about Greg is his flexibility in being able to tailor your workouts to fit your goals and comfort level. I have worked with personal trainers in the past via gyms and have always been scared off from the intensity of the sessions that often left me to sore to create a consistent workout schedule/flow. When I workout with Greg, I feel motivated and have the physical capacity to continue what he taught me and push myself independently. We have been focusing solely on exercises and the impact of form and slow execution to maximize isolating focus areas. He's been encouraging me to start monitoring my diet, which I am ready to incorporate with my exercise schedule. Prior to Greg, I haven't been motivated enough to stay consistent with my workouts. Now I am more confident in using the equipment at the gym as well as exercising independently. He is realistic in his approach and won't pressure you to do exercises you aren't ready for. He is not a drill sergeant -- you need to hold yourself accountable and communicate what you need from him. However, he is very supportive in whichever pace or approach you want to take your fitness in. If I tell him to kick my butt he will and if I say I'm not ready he will find a way to adapt his exercise to my ability until I am strong enough to try again. He has made exercising fun for me and as I continue to see my progress it further encourages me to push forward. Thank you so much Greg!!!",t2x32Y1ybvGtfbCPVJfKlg,Geoffrey L.,90019

Me starting here was a sign from the heavens that it was time to get my fat self up and start moving my body again. I was going to sign up for this gym at one point and put it on the back burner but they texted me for the 6-week challenge on a Thursday saying a challenge was starting on that Monday, well that Monday was my birthday. So if that wasn't a sign I don't know what was.  This may be one of the realist reviews you'll ever read. Before walking into this place I was HUGE, and yes I was the biggest one in the room (still am, but smaller now.) because of my weight. Everyone around me seemed to be athletes all of their lives and I thought they'd be all pretentious and scowling at my fatness, you know the things you think when you're the big person in the room, and you swear you can read the thoughts of everyone around you. Well, what I found was a great team of supportive coaches and motivating classmates who actually care about your well being.  They are all kind, gracious people all with our own separate goals and nobody makes you feel bad about where your starting point is. Mine was in the toilet, lol, I pushed myself a little too hard at first wanting to keep up because I was super hyped by all these Hollywood Bodied People, and in the process, I injured my right knee jumping rope and running. I blame that on my ego of wanting to go so hard when I wasn't prepped for it. Jumping rope was something I'd not done since I was in the 5th grade. When I brought it to my instructor's attention he immediately was on top of it and modified the workouts for me so I could do them without injury, and in that, I have not skipped a beat in my weight loss journey. If you need help ask for it. If you need a better understanding, ask for it. If you aren't sure about something, ask for it, these folks are here to help you, and I can honestly say they've helped me. Again I've been here just a little over 3 months now and from where I started and where I'm heading are night and day. So I highly recommend this gym for those of us who are afraid to get started on changing your weight loss lives and don't know the approaches to getting started. Classes are different every day you never do the same thing twice, and because of that the pounds just peel away with muscle confusion. To date, I've already lost 25lbs. and that's under 3 months, and I couldn't have done it without the support of this gym. Though I am pretty quiet in class everyone there probably has no clue how much they've inspired me to keep going. So with that said I am showing you a picture below of my before and after, the before is a picture I literally took the first week I started, and the after is after my working out there for 3 months. To be clear I started with the 6-week challenge so I was only working out 3 days a week, but when that 6 weeks ended I started working out 5 days a week. Oh, and I will not lie to you I pigged out for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years, BUT because Id started to tone some of my body the Holiday bulge didn't hit me as hard this year as it normally does. What I can see is that there are clothes I wasn't able to wear for YEARS that I can wear now. Shirts that wouldn't button below the first button on my neck are now fully buttoning all the way down on me, and the buttons aren't screaming for help either, they are resting comfortably on my thinning frame. So I'm psyched to see what I'm able to achieve here at Peak 5 because if this is what I can see after only 3 months, I can't wait to see what I look like in a year. I hope this helps someone to make the move to join in with a wonderful group of people, who want to win, and want to see you win. I know this sounds cliche' but truthfully If I can do it, you can do it, I just didn't want to do it, and forced myself to do it. Was it easy? NOPE. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY, and there's no going back from it now, it feels too good, to be getting better. So welcome to the new decade folks we're officially in the 2020s so let's get healthy.  This message was brought to you by a former fat guy who has found his wings to take flight.",RhUOx0WUzPU_3UnmQ0ODgQ,James W.,90029

I was looking to get in shape after many years being out of shape and unmotivated, and I thought CrossFit's social aspect and small classes and higher price would motivate me. Peak 5 happens to be around the corner from my apartment, and it has the best reviews of any gym I've ever read. I was intimidated at first, but Pete and the other coaches have made the gym extremely welcoming. They're down-to-earth, knowledgeable, and kind, and they've been extremely helpful in modulating my workouts for my level. And while the last two months have been physically exhausting, it's been very fun, too. I also like that there's very little of that CrossFit cult stuff, and the members exhibit zero attitude.

I've enjoyed the coaches and have no complaints. There really is no point in getting healthier, for whatever reason, if you're not going to change the unhealthy aspects of your current nutrition habits.  After seeing what it takes to burn off calories and the challenging workouts, I eliminated most sugar/carbs and began running - none of it was easy in the beginning - baby steps. I saw immediate results.  Go at your own pace, I still have to push myself to go to class but always leave feeling invigorated and glad I went.  Especially when you start seeing the results (I fit back in these pants - yes!). In the beginning your body is going to be in so much pain but it's only for about a month until your body acclimates to the workouts - get rest. *Soak in epson salt baths and whatever menthol creams you may need for your knees and other parts of your body that need oil (tin man). What I absolutely noticed was when taking morning classes, I would go to work and a surge of good energy remained for most of the day - I then realized it's body chemicals:dopamine, endorphins,seratonin - I was on a feel good high and you will get addicted - let me take my ass back to Crossfit (once the stress of real life takes effect)!

The program emphasizes restoring function to the body through the use of a series of realigning and corrective exercises designed to work at a very deep layer of the body's muscular system. We program our CrossFit classes using sound science and not just throwing random exercises together.

This gym in particular was the best decision I made while living in California. It gave me the motivation I needed to work out all while also being a part of a community. The coaches went and still does go over and beyond to reassure you're getting most out of your membership. One big plus for me was that they definitely keep you accountable! For instance, one of the coaches when I first started would text me if I didn't show up on a day I usually come. They did not have to do that but that extra step made a huge difference in me, wanting to be consistent. After a year and half I'm the healthy I've been in awhile and I've maintained that weight loss. I lost in total 21 lbs and gained a lot of valuable foundation to maintain that weight loss. If anyone ever gets a chance to take a class with the head-coach Eric I would hands down recommend it. His energy and character is something else haha and trust me you won't be as annoyed at the fact that you woke up at 5:30AM for a class ever again.",DpV_pFG08zK8479sFKWErg,Samrana B.,90027

I joined the six  week challenge, and after my six week challenge I saw a drastic change in my eating habits and confidence in my physical appearance. After six weeks I saw myself forming abs, and a nicer butt. I loved it so much I have made crossfit part of my life style. The six week challenge included workouts that were pre planned for you. They also really mix up the exercises so you never get bored. We also had a nutritionist come in, Annora, on Sundays to educate us on healthy eating habits. One of the things I like about learning from Annora was the mental aspect to eating healthy and being healthy about eating. Being part of this crossfit team has been a lot of fun because I made some friends and I pushed myself a lot during my workouts. All the trainers are so helpful, and after every run we did they were always there to give you high fives after your runs, and workouts. It is a very supportive and friendly environment where people encourage you whether you are crushing it, or struggling to complete your last set. 10/10 would recommend the CrossFit Gym",DIaGuG8mX1nthx1e_0BaCA,French D.,90027

But after yesterday I will never go back. I walk in I smile & say hello and first thing I was told was I am early. my response was oh i know im new and i just have a few questions. The person giving the class said you can go chill at starbucks and come back 5 minutes before class. I mean it is a trial week so maybe I wanted to check out the place and see if i feel comfortable?! Coming from a customer service background i was shocked! At least give me the option to hang around and watch the remaining of the class or something in that sort?!

The owners are awesome and so is the staff. When I left Long Beach I needed to find a boxing gym that I liked as much as the one I trained at there. I was happy to find Fortune Gym, it's a great vibe and you get motivated to work hard because everybody in there is training hard! Now I just need a little punk rock and 90's hip hop? And I'm good to go! Haha thanks to the whole crew for a great place to decompress, get a reset and hit some bags! We all need to hit some shit from time to time.

Multiple Trainers Available",7801 Melrose Ave Suite,4.5,"Gyms,Boxing,Trainers",Fortune Boxing Gym,44,1,Fairfax,1/25/2020,"I just had a really terrible first impression experience here. The gym still, in a lot of ways deserves a higher review. But I had a particularly awful experience near the end, if you keep reading, which explains the one-star. I came for a ClassPass class this morning less than an hour ago. I jogged there, because it was easier than driving. I worked till 2 a.m. at my restaurant job, so it was hard to get there early. I got there at exactly the 10 a.m. mark. The class started at 10. On Classpass there's an ""about"" the class bio portion. Every other boxing studio there mentions the charges for renting gloves, etc. They don't on their page, but, I liked the gym at first glance enough, and the energy of the owner that I figured I could get and keep wraps and maybe like it enough to come back, so I bought wraps and rented gloves and was told to go outside and that the class had started. No one told me who the instructor was or how to find them, which seemed okay, because I figured they would be outside. Maybe they were. Maybe they weren't. But no one proclaimed themself as an instructor, introduced themselves, or gave any direction of what to do. So, I just started following the people running. I realized very soon that I couldn't carry my stuff while running, but was told I shouldn't leave it just about everywhere I put it. The owner said I could put it by the ring, but said he wouldn't leave the gloves or wraps there. So I ran with them. But no one else was. There were no lockers, or directions for where to put anything. Two people running sort of laughed at me saying I didn't have to carry my stuff. I ran back in, quickly. After coming back to put my stuff down against advice, I came back to run. I saw one guy ahead of me. Then soon, no one. I asked a girl out in the alley if we were done or if I should keep going. She yelled keep going. I realized soon she was with the other boxing gym right beside Fortune, not the one I was at. This is very confusing and something to note. Anyway, the longer I ran by myself, the higher my anxiety rose. I came to this class knowing no one, to work out stress and anxiety. I came here to connect back to my body. I was sexually assaulted by my writing partner, who was like a dad figure to me 3 months ago. His wife, home, and dogs were a safe space for me. Since then, I've been really disassociated. But I've taken a few boxing classes since, and felt more connected to my body. I had a bad restaurant shift the night before where people were pretty awful in response to us being severely understaffed, and I made a credit card mistake which could cost me my job. Hey, that's the violence of capitalism, right? So I came to this class this morning with stupendously overwhelming anxiety as is, but was hoping this could be a healing, connective experience to help me forget, feel my power, and make new friends, which is why I got up after 6 hours of sleep to make the class. CUT TO: I come back in to the studio. I'm clearly confused, upset, and on the brink of tears. I tell the blonde girl at the front desk, Alex, that I don't know where my class is, who the instructor is, and wasn't told how many laps to run or where to put my stuff down. I told her that I had incredible anxiety, and started to cry. She cuts me off to tell me the class is in the gym, points to them, and says I can go in with a very unkind, condescending tone. I go to the bathroom to give myself a minute. I come back out and tell her that I just want my $5 and to get out of there. I intended on just leaving, having a good cry, and writing a Classpass review mentioning confusing stuff to to take note of. But that wasn't what happened. Alex raises her voice and becomes incredibly defensive, which was so confusing, as there were no issues I had mentioned that really involved her, until a few moments ago with the frustrating, but not business killing condescension. From there she escalates tensions when she tells me that I should just go to the class, & that I should've asked her where the class was. I told her that I did. (Keep in mind, all of this is happening as I am crying and had just moments ago expressed desperate confusion very clearly.) She more so yelled at me than told me that she was going to get the manager. And she continued to repeat that this shouldn't be such a big deal. She said that like 3 times. Psych/Hospitality 101: When someone has anxiety, the last thing you should ever tell them, as a decent human being, not just a business offering services, is that this really shouldn't be such a big deal. Either way, it's bad business and shows an inability to read people. In the very least, it is unconscious to the realities of the world around you. You've GOT TO check-in with ppl. Especially new ppl, with specifics and direction.",yA6tf91TFcArAr8wUc5uzg,Olivia T.,90046

Some of the lockers are filled with random stuff and couldn't be used. I can deal with all that, but I recently moved and called Jason on 6/21 to let him know I needed to cancel my membership. He said to send him an email so he had it in writing. The payment is charged on the 25th of every month. Jason said the payments were already initiated, but he'd try to stop it. I never heard anything back from the email, and my card was charged on June 25th. My card was just charged again on 7/25. I emailed Jason again to try to get it resolved, but again heard nothing. I had to call my bank to get the charges reversed.",JnDgWxkEuQ8fQxfyq4-ZTg,Jake R.,91403

They charged me on the day the City CLOSED all gyms due to Covid19. In fairness drafts like that start days before and they've said they will offer credit. Friendly response from the manager caused me to modify my review. I keep the membership because I'm in Covina every other weekend. So max 2 visits per month.

I did not expect how spacious the space was being it is a ""mall gym"" but what's really nice are their brand new equipments at par or better to the Super Sport/ Ultra gym I go to. So no surprised I signed up. The staff are really nice, young dude manning the ship, though I still have not received my gym card they do the check-in for me through their reception computers.

,2700 Colorado Blvd,3.5,"Gyms,Trainers",Fitness 19 Eagle Rock,137,2,Eagle Rock,3/4/2020,So I am so happy about the price but you do get what you pay for. The gym seems nice and have no problems with the machines but the staff is mostly young high school students. They seem to let their friends just walk in without paying. This causes the gym to get very overcrowded. It's sucks because as a paying member you want to be able to workout without kids running around and hogging up machines and jumping all over the place when they didn't even pay to get in. I literally watch as the front desk lets their friends just walk right in. I am super disappointed and hope they make a change soon.

The staff always greets me when I scan in and after my workout say thanks for coming in or have a great day. I only train with barbells and in the squat cage/bench press rack.  There is a wait most times for a cage but that time allows me to program my lifts for the day. It can be crowded at peak times but what do you expect?  This is not a private gym, so one just has to deal with it.  I like to come in, lift my weights and leave.  I'm here to strength train not socialize. For the cost per month (20 bucks) I feel its a bargain and I can use other Fitness 19's as well.  My only minor complaints would be that they could use more squat cages and to space them a little further apart.",mvgGg9Jen0payRMYoLMmnw,Mark P.,90041

I once asked a guy at the situps machine who was idly watching TV if I could use the machine and he rudely told me that he was still using it and went back to watching TV.

After moving from NY, I was looking for a very specific vibe.  I wanted to work hard in a fun environment with a standard of coaches / trainers that rivals any elite training facility but at a better price tag.  Found it at Iron.   My coaches are athletes.  They've helped me take my fitness routine from just exercising to peak performance.   Last year, the boxing program hooked me.  Lerone, Elan and Drew are rock stars. Pro fighters with humor, that will work with you on everything from the basic jab to a little two step in between rounds.  They are always positive, funny and eager to teach you something new. Once I got comfortable, I began personal training with Sean Dube.  Sean took me from not knowing how to do a proper squat (no weights) to squatting my own body weight on a barbell!  He is the epitome professionalism. He calendars my workouts/nutrition and bmi so I can track my progress and optimizes it constantly.   It's been a year of consistently training at Iron and my body fat is down by 10%, I'm explosive in workouts where I used to want to throw up in and best of all I feel strong af in life.  I highly recommend Iron, but in particular boxing with Lerone, Elan, Drew and strength and conditioning training with Sean.  Take a class, you won't regret it.",VkftC40vSp8ZevNWX2JwBg,Charlin P.,90404

I'm a big time boxing enthusiast (I like MMA too, but boxing is my game). I like the real stuff. No cardio boxing for me. So on occasion my daughter and I would take a few lessons here at Iron. We've worked with Lerone. So my evaluation is based upon our singular experience with Lerone. IMO, he is top notch. He has had an extensive amateur (Golden Gloves) career. He knows what he's doing. More importantly he can teach what  he knows. So as far as boxing goes (with Lerone) its all good. If I was to criticize I would suggest that they bring back the small boxing ring that they once had. It's always good - IMO - to ""get into a real ring."" I also would suggest they get one or two speed bags. Hey do speed bags help? Who knows? But did you ever see a boxing movie without one? They are iconic ... and I guess do help with timing and rhythm. Yeah boxing is about rhythm after all. I have not experienced any other aspects of this Gym. So I can only comment on it's boxing. I do think Lerone can take you as far as you want to go in boxing though ... if you really want to go far.",mqTMnOTE-Se_E0-3Jd1gtA,Bruce K.,90404

With Toby's help, within 6 months, I was at my strongest and in the best shape of my life, and the dress looked great too!

I drank a vegan smart shake twice a day. I continued my normal weight room routine lifting 4 days a week.  Not once did I feel fatigued or exhausted.  I also didn't lose an ounce of strength.  Very pleased with the clean rise in energy levels.  I lost 10 pounds to start off the New Year, and I didn't break my piggy bank for this challenge.  Highly Recommended!!!!!!!!",hdJ4cX5mKAD9lhkRQI2r9A,Matt A.,90025

At the time Paul was the sole trainer, and he was in the process of expanding the size of the gym and adding even more equipment. Prior to meeting Paul, I had only been (awkwardly) under a barbell once. I really wanted to just get strong and healthy, I actually wasn't even thinking about appearance much. I don't like the typical chaotic and busy gym environment, and to be honest I feel intimidated being in the free weights section. Above all, I wanted to make sure I was doing things right. It seemed pointless to start lifting and be doing things incorrectly or dangerously. I read about Starting Strength and searched to see if there was an SS gym near me, and saw a post on Reddit recommending Horn Strength, so I emailed Paul. Got a super quick, helpful response from him and he was upfront about the options available and costs.

In no way does UCLA's recreation program encourage healthier lifestyles for its former students and even grad students.  Extremely disappointing!!!",xBQXpcEVjTMh5hPz7s8bhA,Timothy T.,90095

The basketball courts are kept up pretty well and are generally open. You can get some good games in, but there is a lot of college students who just joke around on the court. The weights area can get EXTREMELY crowded at peak hours, to the point where it is hard to find a place to do some floor exercises. In addition, the hours are fitted to a college kid's schedule, so it can be a bit of a pain on weekends and Spring/Winter breaks. The best part in my opinion is the price. Most people pay about $40 per month, and you get access to the basketball courts and the gym, which is an amazing deal.

It makes me wonder how many qualified black applicants she denied hire because of her implicit bias that has gone unchecked for what it seems like far too long. I also wonder how she treats black members and patrons as well. I can't imagine she is respectful or hospitable to them. She believes that blacks are not welcome in Santa Monica, even though there are born and bred black Santa Monica natives, and they have every right to live without hate and making a living in Santa Monica just as much as this woman does.

Not good business in my opinion. Unfortunate, they are close and they could have made 900 over the next 3 months by waiving that pointless fee.",tvvm3qljIl0z76WjvHxNWA,Shane F.,90020

Chenell and Dirk are the trainers and they are phenomenal to say the least. They only do up to 5 people at a time and everyone does a circuit that is completely geered towards them. As a woman, I found that weight training with these guys was all I needed to jump start my metabolism. I've lost over 20 pounds and gained beautiful muscle in all the right places.

I had been taking a Zumba Toning class for two years when my instructor decided to quit teaching dance to sell T-Mobile phones out of a van (sore subject, still upset). ANYWAYYYY, on my first visit to LIFT, I was hoping to find a new fitness routine that I loved - and I wasn't disappointed. I trained with Dirk my first session. I had never devoted any time or money to actual weight training, aside from a bundle of Gold's Gym training sessions I was pressured into purchasing when I first moved to LA. I think I bough five sessions and only redeemed two. It just wasn't my thing. Gyms are such a scene and I prefer to work really hard and get the hell out of there. Basically, I was on the ""do cardio, stay as thin as possible"" former chubby girl cycle of fitness. When I filled out my new LIFT member questionnaire, I wrote ""I would love to come here twice a week, but not sure I can make the financial commitment right now."" It's been five weeks and I have been faithfully attending twice a week. When it's this good, you just find the money. So I don't order postmates as much, who cares?? Chenelle and Dirk run this gym in such a way that working out becomes more than a physical obligation. It's fun. It's something I look forward to. Also, I just like them! I look forward to seeing them and working with them to become a stronger version of myself. Everyone is there to kick their own ass fr 30 minutes. There's no ""LA gym"" pretentiousness"" with LIFT.

The music is hype and motivating as well as the instructors.  The only thing is that they do not have showers in case you want to do a class before work.  Overall, I still give it a 5 star for its cleanliness, motivating instructors, effectiveness in shorter duration, friendliness of staff and being located in the heart of West Hollywood!  This place makes me look forward to working out.

She had this beast speedy 1-2-3 combo that I'm determined to master. Also, my music tastes are super aligned with Katie. I don't know what her preworkout ritual/drink is like, but that woman has hella energy at 6:45am. She has a huge selection of throwback hip-hop mixed with a little sprinkle of EDM for those high intensity high-speed segments. I can barely breathe during class, yet still find myself ""shower singing"" along to her entire track list. She's a FAV!! Rise nation is a Bombdotcom new fitness style.

I called and spoke with a lady that did not give me her name and did not want to give me any information, I requested a refund and she said ok I'll take care of that right now.. I requested a confirmation number she said that there was not one; which was a red flag and I told her that did not sound promising and that I would check to see if I received a refund it's a week later I emailed the company twice and they are giving me the runaround this is horrible customer service.

I have attended Sports Training Los Angeles for almost 2 years. I was struggling with my weight and being extremely insecure about working out in a new gym; I would walk in with my head down and close to the wall so no one could see me. Jonathon made me feel like I could do anything and helped me gain back my confidence. Words can't describe how grateful I am for this gym. The energy and the respect this establishment has is beyond amazing. I have never witnessed any bias behavior based on gender, race, religion or sexual orientation; there is always equality spread amongst the trainers and owners of this gym. Sports Training Los Angeles has changed my life; I am confused how this gym could bias towards women when most of it's members are women. I am very happy that I met Jonathon, Coach Rhodes and Sebastian amazing men spreading health, love and fitness in Los Angeles. Thank You.",wMkPL9OUdqGKZtHjqlKb6Q,Sade' H.,90019

Physical fitness goals are important to Jonathan, but what I love about him most is he doesn't shy from encouraging mental goals as well. What I didn't realize until I started working out with him was that your mental strength is just as important as your physical, they go hand in hand an are one in the same. These learnings are important because there are a ton of trainers in LA that solely care about your money, they don't care about how you're feeling, how your body is feeling, ect. - nor do they take the time to ask. 10/10 recommend Jonathan + STLA - I highly suggest checking it out, you won't regret it.",8owSziLVaE2pTBwLmnl54Q,Jade A.,90019

Makes it easy for me to get there and the options of amenities offered. The gym is clean and overall the look is very modern. Definitely different from your usual chain gyms. The equipment is also one of the best you can be using for working out in my opinion. I believe you get what you pay for and the membership for this gym definitely shows that. Another plus would be the views that you get while working out. Though not a huge factor it is still definitely a plus to have and the employees there are always willing to help you when needed.

It's in the Wilshire Grand building which is fairly new. So, the gym has a modern feel with new equipment. In July, the steam room broke down and they closed it for repairs. Some people may not care, but it's a must for me. Initially, members got an email saying it would be open in early August. It is now the end of December and it is still out of service. Apparently, guests of the Intercontinental Hotel use this gym also. You would think a high-end brand hotel would put a little more urgency into getting something like this fixed (I spoke with one hotel guest who was disappointed). They are now doing promotions to get others to join. Maybe if you fixed your steam room you'd get more interest. 5 months and counting!

Yes, the workouts are challenging and ass-kicking, but doing tough things in a supportive environment makes it a little easier and a thousand times more enjoyable. Owner and coach JP is a great leader, and personally, I have been inspired and motivated by Ganbatte's very own Wonder Woman, manager and coach Pheby. She works so hard to keep everything running like clockwork, and is always there to answer questions, concerns, or just have a laugh or a cry with. I always love her classes, and usually find myself giggling or silly dancing. With Pheby's support I deadlifted 200 pounds and blew my mind. I didn't think I was capable of that, but she did. Coach Pheby and Coach JP also coached me through my first half marathon and helped me crush my goal. Coach Pheby was by my side to celebrate at the finish line. I will never forgot that moment.

Just imagine someone coming into your house and being disrespectful, same concept. Also, true story, I'm not instafamous. So there's another urban myth solved.

It's the first ever gym that I can come, warm up, work out in peace, go hard, do what makes me happy, meditate, relax, be myself, enjoy yummy food and drinks, then go home feeling great. There are always machines available and it's super clean! No stank! No rude/crazy/reckless people. Everyone respects the facility and the members. There are no problems with parking and the owner is very personable. He respects his clients and it is very easy to tell that he actually cares. Yes, it is pricey (compared to boxhouse gyms) but you get what you pay for. I can work out without any distractions and feel safe, also. They have cameras overlooking all parts of the gym so I don't have to always watch my back for a weirdo. It smells really nice at the gym and the weights are always racked in the correct spots, I love it! If you have OCD, come here and you will instantly calm down, lol (truth). I love how clean it is and how they focus on quality not quantity of memberships sold. Equipment is all brand new and well maintained, too. No noobs slamming plates or yelling/ grunting. It took me only 1 walk around to sign up. I literally went to my old gym, cancelled my membership, returned to NLTF and signed up quick.

I've trained here for My powerlifting  meets and the equipment meets the standards for both strength training as well as endurance training. Body building is the focus: but there are two solid squat racks and a few bench racks so it's good for power lifting athletes as well. I like the solitude and the independent users who are focused on their individual gains. There's music playing in the back but nothing you can't drown out with a good set of headphones.

At Future Health, we want you to benefit from the latest research now, that has not reached the mainstream and unfortunately it probably won't for decades.

The science is available now to get into great shape and enjoy much better health effortlessly. You don't need to deprive yourself on starvation diets or having to do exhausting exercise.

Here's just some of the unique features that set Future Health apart:
- Only 20 minute invigorating exercise
- Appointment based sessions with your instructor
- Personalized nutrition plans (including Paleo, low-carb, traditional, vegetarian, gaps, etc.)
- Education workshops on nutrition, health, exercise and psychology

All in a stunning state-of-the-art premises on the 57th floor of the U.S. Bank Tower.

I liked that I could workout, shower and leave within 35 minutes but the personal attention was the best part. At first, they keep a close eye on you to make sure you're keeping the proper form, it's almost like a one-on-one workout, but as you get more used to it the trainers won't hover as much. You'll think that they're not paying attention but the second you start to use bad form, someone is there correcting you. And if you're coasting, they'll be putting more weight on the machine, making sure you get the most out of every workout, or giving you an additional exercise to keep pushing you but without any drill sgt. theatrics.",CMy3aiIk8jUHKRUsCqwg3A,Jay S.,90071

I saw someone said they only had one shower in the men's locker room but there are three now so keep in mind a lot of stuff has been updated since the older posts. And I concur with the other people who say this is a no frills gym but it's not a no frills gym in the sense that everyone in there is super intense and in crazy good shape (which is what I interpreted by the saying).

I love the fact that it works with the dream center and helps motivate people who are not really knowing what direction they want to go with their fitness. I LOVE the fact that everything isn't in one place. There is a separate room for weights and it's always so pleasant and very clean.

But with it being so small I think the machines could be getting more regular maintenance. Taped elliptical machines with the mechanical components exposed is inexcusable. For the money people are paying I think a little more upkeep is doable. Other than that I think it's a clean place but you need signs reminding people to wipe off the sweat on the machine when they are done, gross.

Gym just got a minor refurb (fresh paint, etc.) and after talking to the manager, it sounds like they're getting some new equipment soon too (he mentioned an upgraded rowing machine). According to their site they're expanding their hours too, a major bonus... as of right now they close early on Thursdays and aren't open at all on Sundays, but seems like this will change in 2019.

For example this one time I came to the gym and it said closed sat - mon I believe then I come on Tuesday and it's still closed ? Wtf ? Completely unsatisfied,even though it's less than most gyms it is not worth the 25 $. And don't get me started on the bathroom... disgusting... I once puked in there because I really had to use it so I went in and could not handle the smell :/ everyone that gave this place 5 stars probably works there or is associated with that place in some way because it is NOT 5 stars ... if you give this place 5 stars you are a LIAR",kZvtwApkLvjgFt8hMwTEDg,Jorge C.,90026

Thanks, DC Fitness Staff",626 Coronado Ter,4.5,"Gyms,Trainers",DC Fitness,20,5,Echo Park,11/17/2016,"A community gem. I've recently moved back into the area and have been looking for a good gym to join. Glad I stopped by DC Fitness before checking out the gyms in DTLA (LA Fitness, PF, 24 Hour, etc) as it has turned out to be perfect for my needs, with none of the downsides of a typical gym. I'm mainly at the gym to lift so I was looking for a squat rack and bench. Was very surprised to find both of those as well as deadlift stations in a community gym such as this! If you're looking to do cardio, they've got a dedicated cardio room and a small grass area for plyos, with a couple basketball courts upstairs. Staff members could not be friendlier (shout out to Mike) and are available for any questions you've got on specific exercises or for personal training (I believe they are all certified). The price is great. DC Fitness maintains community access to its facilities with a low membership cost of $25 a month with a one-time $15 initiation fee. Month-to-month, no forced year-long contracts like other gyms. While the price is reflected in its selection of older machines and equipment, they are all still serviceable and have done just fine for my workouts. Lots of free weights available, yoga mats, foam rollers, jump ropes, two punching bags, medicine balls, and more. The gym is clean and has had cleaning solution and paper towels stocked every time I've gone. There's one restroom and one shower for men, with the shower area first sectioned off with a large shower curtain (no door, so pull it over to indicate you're occupying the space), and the shower itself behind another curtain. Bring your own towel, soap, and sandals.",PQEjUFvFogNw3WpJo24ACg,Wayne W.,90026

Steve even visited the site of the test on his own on several occasions just to survey the equipment and make even more specific adjustments to my brother's training. Today it all paid off! With his Culver City Police brothers looking on, his trainers pushing him forward - he was able to pass that test today. It could not have been done without the commitment of Steve and his team. So congratulations to my brother and a huge thank you to all of you at A Tighter U. ",b4EwceyvqzimFuIA-UsgOQ,Van L.,90232

I signed up for a free class that they were offering for elites and got admitted right away... I guess not many people were down to sweat. You guys missed out! Ricky Jaime got me going and kept me hyped, what a crazy intense class. So, I got in about 5 minutes late (traffic sucks when you're coming from the valley) and was greeted by BIG smiles behind the counter. I made a dumb joke about how I thought that this was a yoga class... um yeah, they assured me it was not. So I walk in and the workout has already started, pitch black room and all that is lit up is the lights inside the spinning water of the row machine... so I told myself ""get to rowing' girl!!"" And then I died. HA! I went crazy and all out for the entire 45 minutes, I was not prepared whatsoever. So, we would row, with as much speed as we could perpetuate, for a slow 15 second count, and then we'd hop off and do sets with the wall straps, stretch and stop to drink if needed, and then get back on that row machine! Towards the end of the session, we did push ups and crunches on the mats in place of the wall exercises... and then hopped back on that machine! I felt so good after, so good! Like, mostly dead, but good. I swear more than I have sweat from any other workout, ever. Ricky had the music pumping to the fast paced beat of the workout, everything was so loud and energetic, such a fun class.

Given that Jason seemed pretty familiar with a lot of the faces I did feel a little excluded. Overall, the class was good because structurally it was a good full-body workout.

The workouts are efficient and at the same time not dreadful. The 45 minutes go by fast so working out doesn't feel like a never ending torture, it's fun and you feel so good about yourself after. If you keep a routine you will see results! It's all about consistency! Everyone is friendly and during class the trainer will go around correcting form which is very helpful for anyone new to fitness. I love the music and they also have lockers here where you don't need to bring your own lock. They also have showers, changing rooms, and a water refill station. Everything is kept very nice and clean. I had one issue and it was actually due to just a misunderstanding of their no show/late policy. One of the owners contacted me right away and clarified miscommunication so we were able to rectify the situation immediately. I'm appreciative of businesses that are run this way. They are genuinely good caring people and not just a business only interested in taking your money. I've tried out a few circuit training gyms around LA and this one seems to be the best.",tJJBJU_87xYtVpCedSw5WQ,Carolynnjean C.,90012

They are very involved with the people in a workout. Always checking your form and motivating you incessantly to push it just a little bit more. On top of that, it is always good to see trainers working out with you **Shout out to Reid**. Test your own product as they say. Alizon is a great and very responsive Manager/Trainer. She runs a tight ship. The workout room is spacious and the equipment always feels fresh.",vPiyFbLQX2bCQy2Ls8hEcw,Siddhartha S.,90012
