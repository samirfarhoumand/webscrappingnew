I actually live much closer to the Van Nuys location (within walking distance), but I have stayed loyal to the Sherman Oaks gym for several reasons. First of all, it's true that it is smaller and not as new, but it is far less crowded. I usually go to the gym when I get out of work, typically between 4 and 5, and I have rarely ever had to wait for a treadmill to do my warm-up (sure, Van Nuys is bigger and has more treadmills, but I've always had to wait to use one when I've gone there). I am shocked by some of the reviews I have seen that mention unhelpful staff members. The staff is a huge reason why I have continued at this location. They are all very friendly and make me feel comfortable when I have questions. This place has more of a ""community"" feel, and the staff is really approachable. When I first joined, I decided to sign up for personal training, since I wanted to start doing strength training, but was kind of lost on where to begin. I'm so happy I did this! I've been working with Dean for most of this time and have had a great experience. He knows his stuff, cares about my goals, listens when I want to try something different, and is incredibly flexible and responsive if I need to reschedule a session. He has even taken the time, on multiple occasions, to show me an exercise or answer my questions on days when I do not have a scheduled session with him. Also, what I love about doing training with LA Fitness in general, is that Dean writes all of my work outs down when I do them, so I can refer back to them and work on them throughout the week. I'm seeing the results I want, have learned a lot and feel a lot stronger than I used to.",aeMuZ7zt49bEN5zN25WRpQ,Lea S.,91401

I joined another LA fitness nearer my house, which is nicer and fairly new, this one is on my way home from work so I thought I'd try it out. It's a converted raquetball club from the 80's. It wasn't really designed for treadmills or other cardio machines so they are all lined up in a row down a narrow hall way... very strange. When I was there not one raquetball court was in use but most of the cardio machines were, I would recommend that they remodel and rip out some of the raquetball rooms and make room for a proper cardio room.

I think the reception staff are friendly and helpful and the place is clean. Trouble is, it's old and there's only so much that can be done to make it feel fresh. Many of the machines are ancient and one of the elliptical machines has been out of service for months, with no sign of it being repaired. This is an issue because there are only two elliptical machines that are convenient for me to use- others are in locations where there are no TV screens and just above where classes are held so the noise level is unacceptable for me. With one machine out of service, I often cannot do that part of my workout. When I asked one of the staff about why the elliptical machine was not being repaired, he said, ""That's not my department. You can call back tomorrow and talk to so and so."" In my opinion, the only correct response would have been, ""Thanks for sharing your concerns.

Only one restroom, which is stupid. As for equipment and weight times It does get crowded but I usually don't have to wait for a cardio machine and if I do, I'm not waiting long. The parking lot is terrible. It's narrow and dangerous and people drive like idiots during peak hours. Typical LA. There is street parking in the vicinity though.

Apart from an occasional inconsiderate member who doesn't wipe a machine down after using it, the place is clean and employees helpful when needed.

I felt so uncomfortable with people being able to watch us from the second floor as they were on the cardio machines. The yoga class it self was probably the worst I've ever taken in my life! The teacher was not very verbal and everyone kept getting lost since she would just change positions out of nowhere without telling us how she even got there, she just expected us to know how to do everything. She sounded like a broken tape recording with her little mantra that wasn't even helpful to the practice just saying ""Remember you chose to be here"" 10 times!

,5300 Coldwater Canyon Ave,3.0,"Gyms,Trainers,Yoga",LA Fitness,286,5,Valley Village,6/19/2018,"So I started with a 5 day free pass and ending up getting a membership! Honestly check it out for yourself as I found that the reviews here are widely misleading. Let's start with the equipment. There is plenty!! I enjoy the unique layout, and there is also a spa jacuzzi in the women's locker room (I'm sure men's as well) which was a perk I wasn't aware of before coming in. Saul gave me the tour of the place and was very informative and gave me a great deal. The staff in general is extremely friendly, down to earth, and professional which is refreshing because at my previous place they were...let's just say ""not"" lol. My enrollment included a private training session which I think is great because I can get intimidated working out by myself and having them offer me a free plan was awesome. Hayden was a great private trainer and I will be using him again in the future for sure. Got me up and working out on our first training session which is killer because few trainers take the time to do that. We started the routine going over diet and fitness goals with specific measurements and numbers which I find to be very helpful in hitting my goals. Then the workout--Ohhhh boy hahah I'm so sore but I feel amazing! I feel like all the target areas I talked about with Hayden before, he implemented perfectly. Also important note- not intimidating! I've had trainers that make me feel bad if I need to break but Hayden was constantly asking if I needed water or a break which shows that he genuinely cares about his clients, so if you are intimidated, just know LA Fitness has hired great people to their training team. There were other trainer/trainees next to me and it was just an all around positive atmosphere. ",purlZpy4VIZ6iPea8EJWFQ,Kate W.,91401

They went from having like 15 bags to like 5 with one that is broken. A lot of people use the bags for boxing workouts and now there is empty space with not enough bags. I hope you get fired!

They and the devoted and kind members are why I continue coming back!! Unfortunately the facilities do not match up. Most the equipment is old, outdated, and dirty. Even the new spin bikes are consistently breaking. There is also a serious shortage of fitness classes - especially total body/boot camp style classes. In years prior, they would start with early morning classes and continue through the day and offer a variety each night. The earliest class is now 8:15am which is simply not feasible for someone who works a 9-5. I'm hopeful this will change in the future and, in the meantime, I'll keep coming for the people!",1MMuH642NDS559wUT_dGVg,Annie K.,91601

The pros about this YMCA location are related to the staff; they are always friendly and extremely helpful when I have a question. Also, this location is never packed so it feels peaceful at times. Now for the cons, the men's lockeroom has a nasty smell and is usually dirty. Many of the lockers are broken. The equipment is outdated and it is a bit small. I have been a member at about six different YMCA locations around LA County. This location is one of my least favorites, but it's close to home. I only stay because the YMCA is an organization that I support. They charge the same amount monthly as some of the really nice and modern YMCA locations, they should consider making little changes to compete.

My daughter attendant  swimming lessons over 2 years started from beginner to intermediate level now. The teachers are great. But the only one sad thing that you never know the teachers schedules. Once your child likes one teacher she/he has to be with other teacher in next session. And this brings stress to your child sometimes. We had one session like that when my daughter rejected to be with one teacher not because the teacher wasn't good enough but because she already accustomed to other teacher and liked him.

I have been doing Pilates for about four years and I've been to almost every studio in Beverly Hills and the Westside. I have yet to find an instructor like Ashlee. Her studio is small, which I love. She is a ""stickler"" for form and she switches up the classes all the time. Many of the exercises we do I've never done before- my body is constantly being challenged. Ashlee is sweet, calm and brings great energy. By far my #1 choice for an instructor and studio in Los Angeles.",86Vr_eMeBjrV1X3amrlhvQ,Sara S.,90034

The coaches seem genuinely happy to interact with the kids, and they are very attentive the whole time, supervising but also playing and coaching, compared to places I've been where you rarely get more than a greeting when you walk in the door.

,7318 Santa Monica Blvd,4.5,Pilates,Club Pilates,116,5,,7/1/2014,I love this place! Club Pilates is a great place to get your workout in for the day. Melody is always having deals around the holidays so there are always times where you can get a class package and each class is only $10!! My favorite instructors are Ashlee and Chrissie. Chrissie is good to go to your first time because she is all about form and doing the moves properly while not stacking on the weight which is good for people with back problems like me. She also try's out different moves and has a variety of moves to do.  Ashlee is amazing! I am always sore the next day! She is constantly doing new moves and combinations of moves together causing more burn. She rarely repeats exercises in the same week so you are always learning new things with her. Ashlee by far has the best music out of any of the teachers! And you can find her on sound cloud if you want her playlists. If you show up late to class she will call you out on it and  you deserve to be called out because your distracting the whole class from their workout. I think if anyone is late or a no show they should have to pay a fee. Everyone is going to prefer one instructor over the other but this is just my opinion :o) I have tried most to all of the instructors however now that I've been going here since November I stick to Ashlee and Chrissie! I've never left Ashlee's class feeling like I need another workout! Just make sure you sign up for the right class level because if you sign up for a level 2 and you've never taken Pilates before prepare to get your ass kicked! Ashlee and Chrissie are also accommodating when it comes to body issues. I have back and neck problems so they are always giving me different things to do when I am feeling pain. Some of the instructors stack on the weight which I don't like because I am not trying to get thick thighs so I avoid those instructors... Anyways overall it's a great studio and the pricing is always great and there's a free parking lot to park in. They also hold fun events at the studios!,SBzy5M_pGUuUTewPhHDn4g,Kristal B.,90046

I have worked previously for Equinox Fitness as their designer, and I have grown very particular about teaching standards, quality, professionalism and cleanliness. Since moving to LA I have tried numerous clubs, studios and fitness hybrid models- but nothing has ever stuck. Club Pilates offers a great value and the classes are top notch. I have had more challenging classes, certainly, but I would argue that just because something is physically harder doesn't make it better. The movements and challenges I have experienced in class are consistent with my fitness goals, and I have seen various students at different levels all accommodated with ease. I have tried just about every pilates studio in Hollywood, on the Eastside and on the Westside, and I can comfortably say that Club Pilates fills all my needs: great studio, great staff, clean, great environment.

I am a very active person who works out at the gym 5-6 days a week at a minimum of 90 minutes and yet I STILL had these ""stored fat"" trouble spots on my body which were difficult to burn. So a friend suggested that I try a weigh-loss program that target's stored fat with the help of a homeopathic called ""HCG"" at Firm Body Evolution. I only had about 10 pounds that I wanted to loose but it was really about loosing the stored fat in certain stubborn areas of my body. After 10 weeks of the HCG diet program I lost my 10 pounds and my body also finally released the stubborn stored fat that was the bane of my existence.  When I started the diet I decided to try a ""day pass"" which included three sessions I like to call the ""FBE Three"": 1. Whole Body Vibration (Shake it!)  2. Pneumatic Compression Body Massage (Squeeze it!)  3. Infrared Sauna (Sweat it!) and I saw instant results in terms of ""shrinkage"" and overall body tone.  So I decided to buy a package and returned to FBE for a few more ""FBE Three"" sessions and began to see DRAMATIC results not only the appearance of cellulite, overall toning and shrinkage but also my skin appearance had a healthier glow, my acne cleared up, my sleep had improved and my mental clarity was purified.  I can only attribute this to the intense amount of circulation that the body experiences with these incredibly advanced machines found exclusively at Firm Body Evolution.  So I decided to become a MEMBER and alongside of my normal fitness routine at the gym and eating a healthy whole and balanced diet- I am FINALLY the weight and shape that I was working so hard to achieve.  It was all made possible because of the advanced technology at FBE's exclusive spa- from the machines, to the alkaline water, to the Body Composition Analysis machine I feel as if I am 100% knowledgeable about what's going on inside my body so that I can see the results on the outside. Now whenever I book a role of TV or I am just looking for that detoxed slim feeling inside and out I know where to go: I am an FBE devotee for life!",aSsAkplJhZMtxXCnEIt6Lg,Danielle B.,90049

I give this location 3 stars because overall it's a good gym. The staff is a completely different story.  I joined the gym through a family add-on so I got a great deal, Jason was super helpful and very nice so if you need anything or have a question be sure to look for him.  He's the only friendly face of the bunch.  When I first joined I had a ""free"" session with a trainer which turned out to be a complete waste of my time.  I rather not mention his name but if you read the other yelp reviews you'll see his name.  He was rude, cocky and seemed very uninterested rushed through the whole hour.  In the end I said no to their personal trainer program not because of the cost but because he was a jerk and didn't want to contribute to his recruitment points.  When you walk in no one ever greets you they just sit there with a sour face.  I had trouble with one of their treadmills the other day, on my way out I told the girl at the front desk she seemed uninterested in what I had to say.  I think it bothered her that I made her work, and by work I mean pick up the phone to call to report the faulty treadmill.

Very few people re-rack their weights and there are plates and free weights every where on the floor. Not only is this inconvenient (I can never find the ones that I want), but can also be dangerous. I wanted to file a complaint to corporate, but couldn't find anywhere online. So the next time I asked the lady at the front desk and she told me that I could tell her my complaint. I told her all this and she acknowledged the problem and then blamed it on the ""neighborhood"". What's that supposed to mean?! No solution was given to me. I realize that this may be a problem at other gyms, but I've never seen it this bad. Usually the staff goes around and picks up what's been left on the ground, but not here. I always see the staff either talking with each other or with their friends in the gym or on their cell phones. There is no effort to enforce re-racking to the clientele.

The receptionist is rude and unwelcoming and the manager isn't any better. I went in to inquire about a membership and asked if I could try the gym just for one day but was told by the receptionist that they don't do guest passes/one day passes which is fine but she didn't advise me how to go about getting one in the future. She then offered to have the manager come over and talk to me. While waiting for the manager 3 young men came in for the same reason as I and the receptionist happily let them in. I mentioned this to the manager and he defended the receptionist by saying that one of the boys had a membership and that's why he was able to get his friends in. I deliberately heard the boy say that he only had a guest pass so I refuted his claim and he allowed me to try the gym for the day. Although I was able to test out the facility, the road to getting there was like pulling teeth. The facility was somewhat clean but it was very busy (I went around 10:30 AM on a Tuesday). The bathrooms were also a gross mess!! They have a lot of machines but some of the equipment was bent/messed up/in bad shape and this made working out a little more tedious.

I felt that I paid a lot (100/session) to see no results. My body is very frustrating and I come with a few medical conditions that I have to work against so have to work twice as hard. I knew that going in and made sure my nutrition side was handled and that I was working my hardest in the exercises they gave. I did a trial for 5 weeks because that is all I could really afford at the time. They are very nice of course and super supportive. They said I could do fewer sessions and they would give me exercises for home (which wasnt always the case though). I also believe they may be great for those with normal metabolisms/bodys that only need a normal workout to see results. Unfortunately, I am not one of those. I also felt a little uncomfortable at times, I know trainers hitting on young women is a thing but I hoped to avoid it with sessions at such a high price. I am just a friendly person and of course am social but also hoped I was in a safe setting.

The people working here are all scammers. I had a trainer offer me sessions for a month and if I did not like it I could cancel them. Anyway he had me sign some papers, I had my sister as a witness there thankfully, where he explained it was the usual ones where if I was injured it wouldn't be their fault or so he said. After 3 sessions I decided to cancel because I felt like the sessions weren't anything I couldn't do myself so I went up to him to cancel and he gives me a puzzled look and tells me well you have to pay half of theses years worth of sessions if you want to cancel. I informed him of what he told me and he said ""well you signed a contract"" and he shows me the online form I signed where he had told me it was just basic forms. He lied to me and I left upset and almost in tears because I felt stupid for being conned and signing things without reading it through but he also did not let me see the computer screen as I signed and it was my fault for thinking an establishment such as this would never do something like this. Anyway I was angry and did my research. Next day I confront the ""operations manager"" with a very detailed letter of what happened and I asked him if he knew his trainers where scamming people and what they were doing was completely illegal (which it is). He looked shocked but in a very fake way and told me not to worry nothing would be charged.

It bugs me when somebody puts their gym bag or clothes or water in three stations so no one else can use them and it's just not right. I think management should look at these people and tell them not to do this.  And then afterwords when he finally left the guy did not even replace the weights back into the rack. I think more signs that say please replace weights back into the rack when you are finished should be put up. Also maybe a sign that says do not overtake more than one workout station at a time.

The lady's helping me out were great. The sauna is the best as well as the fat shaking machine. However they lost points with me for the service I received from management. I paid for a 10-20-30 workout awhile back and never used it. Not only was I not told that it expires, but they charged me full price for it again. The least they should have done was given me some kind of a discount towards the one I used today since I originally paid for something. I think it was pretty shady not to tell me it will expire when I bought it. I think it's wrong in general to put an expiration date on a workout that you bought. You should be able to have the freedom to go anytime you want if you paid for it. The manager was there the whole time I was talking to the cashier about this and she kept saying she was going to let her manage her know and send her an email. I got a response hours later that they couldn't do anything about it because it expired but they'll offer me whatever the yelp discount was offering.

I travel a lot for work and when I am home I always have a pretty packed schedule, so it has been a challenge for me to find time to get to the gym and sauna.  At FBE, I am able to get my cardio, weights and sauna/detox all done in one place and usually all within one hour. This is exactly what I have needed !! Finally I found a place that really works for me and my schedule -so I am able to stay motivated to get into the gym now, even when I have a crazy schedule.  The facility is very clean and, since it is private, there is never more than a few people there at a time, which is a nice alternative to the chaos and noise of larger gyms. The staff is friendly and eager to help and answer questions. The trainers are all very knowledgeable and professional. Joseph, the owner, is great and he really knows his stuff when it comes to fitness, health and wellness.  The infrared sauna pods are such a relaxing treat at the end of my workout and they are so easy to just hop in and out of without having to get undressed like I would have to do at the spas. I am happy to report that for the first time in almost three years of trying, I am actually losing weight because the 10/20/30 method works! Also I love the atmosphere and the staff there so I am finally consistent in my exercise. I can't say enough good things about FBE!!!",q-yF5g8XgdRb1MGMCRGU3w,Meg M.,90049

When I was away, I noticed less energy, more anxiety, weight gain and overall just not as healthy.  When I utilize the sauna, I notice better skin, better breathing, mental calmness, grounding and I do feel that it helps keep my weight in check (I do come out of the sauna heavily sweating).",CpnYzTyO4bDrGKwBOcIo8A,Tara G.,90049

The customer service is literally a Zero at sauna bar. The ladies at the front don't offer water for your experience or say thank you when you leave. Happened BOTH times I went.

Spent a few hours browsing their website and reading reviews and decided to make an appointment. I didn't plan to purchase any services, but I mainly wanted to learn more about what they had to offer. I ended up getting a massage, where you slip into the cocoon thing, and really didn't feel like it did too much to relieve tension. A massage from an actual person feels much more invigorating, in my opinion. Thought I'd give one of their other services a try the next day and hopped into the pod where you sweat out all your toxins. I purchased a $9 watermelon juice afterward, which was great, but hardly worth $9. It seems that to really feel differently and to see changes in yourself, you have to be a regular customer and visit 2-3 times a week. I would love to be able to do that, but it's just so dang expensive. If they could slash their prices a bit, I'd be more of a fan, but I really don't see the need to charge customers an arm and 2 legs for these services.",CEsxuhCm8IalcXUhlZpZEw,Janna L.,90049

Maybe it's just her personality and I shouldn't have taken anything personally, but in my earlier days of pilates, she spoke to me in a very condescending tone and made me feel extremely embarrassed and discouraged to continue.

The owner, Kate, has taught at many studios; I took some classes with her at Goda Yoga many years ago. She is smart, funny, and creative. It is fantastic that she started her own place.

And that depth is the key to a good workout, you need something that pushes you, that you enjoy doing. Not only will you be burning fat and building muscle, but you'll be learning a real, useful and physically demanding martial art in the process.

In addition to all this we use functional and fun equipment to round out your conditioning: ropes, ladders, medicine balls, bands and, most importantly, your own body weight, not to mention nutritional coaching if your goal is weight loss. Every workout is a challenge, and no two sessions are the same.

My sister and I have been working with him since February 2015 and are still meeting with him every week to this day (literally--we worked out a couple hours ago, lol). I've always been skinny, but I've never felt healthier or stronger than I do now. But before I go too in depth, I want to preface this by saying that I absolutely HATE working out. Don't get me wrong, I love sports and other outdoor activities, but I wasn't getting the strength training I wanted. So I tried classes, videos, gyms--whatever you can think of--but could never find something I really enjoyed or could stick with. Being inside a gym just felt miserable and depressing, and I had no idea what I was doing--I would just hop on random machines, do a few sets, and hope I'd get results. I would get discouraged when I couldn't keep up with other people in a class or even do the exercises and movements correctly. That's where Matt came in--I was looking for an affordable personal trainer who would give me the attention I needed; someone who would encourage and support me--not yell at me or make me feel pathetic or lousy--and that's exactly what Matt does. Of course he challenges you and holds you accountable--he checks in to make sure we're doing our homework and even follows us on MyFitnessPal--but he is super friendly and understanding and works at your pace, tailoring each workout to your individual needs, concerns, and limitations. He doesn't judge you, but instead makes you feel comfortable and confident in what you're doing. All in all, I really think we hit the jackpot with Matt. So much so that we can't imagine working with any other personal trainer besides him. Sorry Matt, you're stuck with us!!!",UzuUlsO6dcvPlwZjUD6gFg,Lisa A.,90024

I have trained with these guys for 5 months and each class is a challenge and i have NEVER seen them half ass any lesson ever. what i like is that they document and follow your progress very closely- they have a master plan to develop you as a fighter (even if you are like me and never plan on fighting).

In addition to all this we use functional and fun equipment to round out your conditioning: ropes, ladders, medicine balls, bands and, most importantly, your own body weight, not to mention nutritional coaching if your goal is weight loss. Every workout is a challenge, and no two sessions are the same.

Try a session - it's 100% guaranteed - if you don't love it, you get your money back! Give us a call, tell us about what your personal goals are and let's get training!",1300 Veteran Ave,5.0,"Trainers,Boxing,Martial Arts",FightFit Personal Trainers,58,5,Westwood,8/23/2016,"Matt and Jorge are the best at teaching.

Clearly those people ought to run as fast as they can to 24 Hr. Fitness or another of the upscale venues nearby, because they are missing the community aspect of the Y. This Y, while outdated, has a FIT LINXX program on every machine which makes not having personal trainers fine. This is a diverse, hard-working community and the Y is a reflection of that -- easy to access, open at good hours, new equipment, well maintained and great babysitting services. OK, it does indeed need a facelift, new locker rooms and could use a pool upgrade. But having said that, it HAS an Olympic size pool, with great teachers. The price is right, it's a family and community environment ...and if you can't afford the monthly fee, they will make alternative arrangements.

They seemed cramped and crowded and the ceiling was low.

However, for me personally, this YMCA is almost like a 2nd home and has served me well. Staff is friendly. All the basic equipment are available. Different types of classes available. The men in the weight room are generally courteous. The facility isn't too big (limited locker space, shower), but it adds to the intimate family feel of a YMCA.

The parking lot on the side accomodates around 20 cars though there is ample street parking for everyone.

Machines are available too for cable exercises since the weight room gets crowded easily and a ton of equipment for cardio as well . If you're the kind of person that's motivated by group workouts this YMCA has a ton of classes like Zumba, Yoga, Pilates, HIIT, Cycling, etc. If you're into Zumba, they have classes every other day around 6pm. If you're not into Zumba, try to avoid the YMCA during this time slot because the place gets really crowded. Anyway, just give this place a try and trust me it is worth it.

Over the years, I've noticed how much this workout have changed me not just by the way I look from the outside but how I feel on the inside as well. Thanks to Bar I've improved my posture, flexibility and strength. Every time I come out of a grueling workout I feel stronger (a lot more sore) and calmer at the same time. No matter how hectic or stressful life can get I owe it to Bar to give me that hour to myself. Bar Method reminds me daily to be thankful to have a strong mind and to have a body that has the ability to complete the challenging workouts. The teachers really strive to create an environment that's both warm and welcoming both to new and old students. I've made a lot of friends through Bar and I really enjoy seeing all of the lovely ladies (and gents) every time I come in, which makes the workout so much more fun!

Mind you before hand I did my research on trainers who prep for shows. Most were online only and outrageously priced for never being able to train one on one in person. This was huge for me because I didn't feel comfortable with skyping someone for something I would be working so hard to achieve. In addition to one on one training I loved how she mapped out everything from diet to weekly work out goals. It is so easy for me to understand and plan my daily schedule. Then there is additional things she has done like being a text/call away for any advice or questions I may have. This is what was so surprising to me because she didn't have to do that but it showed how much she cares about my goals and my dreams of competing. You won't get that with an online coach or any trainer at that. I highly recommend her if your serious about your health and fitness.

I can go on and on about how wonderful she is, but I will keep this review short so that I do not bore you. All in all, I highly recommend her because she helped me realize all the junk food I was eating, she pushes me during our workout sessions, and she is so friendly and always asks about myself.

Also, they provide free gloves and wraps for the first time so why the hell not try it right? Jonathan and Freddie are probably the two nicest trainers I have met (trust me I have met many).

Not only was I impressed by the quality of the skills that they taught in the boxing class but they also offered additional classes that I was interested in. If I wanted to train in mma or do crossfit style classes I would have to join one or more separate gyms. I love that they are offered here with a membership along with yoga and TRX classes.

I usually don't review a place I have only been to once, but I had a really positive experience here so I had to share. I took Durek's Body Burn Pilates class here recently and it challenged me at such an intense level, it has been all I can think about lately. The room is really tiny and generally I don't like being in small, confined spaces, but this class was so high-energy, and Durek had such positive energy that I sort of forgot about my issues with space. I arrived a bit late for the class so had no other choice but to sit front and center for the entire class to see. Now that will motivate you to bust your ass like none other so that you don't embarrass yourself in front of everyone, and that is exactly what happened for me. The instructor, Durek was wonderful and gave us ladies, one hell of a workout. I have been sore ever since (wow, that sounded all kinds of wrong, didn't it?)

Everyone from the clients to the coaches are all friendly, supportive and helpful. I joined the 5 week challenge at what I would consider my rock bottom. I was depressed, angry, the largest I'd been my entire life, and in pain. I was desperate and needed a way out of the hole I had dug myself into. The moment I stepped through those doors at the informational seminar, I knew this place was different. These were people who actually cared about your success and were honest about the hard work it would take to get you to where you wanted to be. These past 5 weeks have been life changing for me. With the help of extraordinary coaches, like Coach Hector Lozano, I was able to go from almost getting sick and passing out to doing two sessions in one day. Coach Lozano helped modify exercises I wasn't able to do to still obtain the maximum benefits from the workouts. Aside from losing 12 lbs and the physical changes that come with it, I can honestly say that the changes in my emotional and mental states have been the biggest accomplishment. Doubt, fear, struggles and all of the negativity that prevented me from following through are now more than welcomed... they make me push harder and make me stronger, because I have the confidence in myself to overcome them. I am no where close to where I want to be, but you best believe I'm on my way! Hands down the BEST team I've ever had the pleasure of working with!

I've always been a part of a team every since I was young and in softball. So graduating, entering the real world, and going to college I started to lose time and was unable to continue working out like I used to. I always believed in going to the gym for 2 hours which consisted mainly of weight lifting and limited cardio. At times I would always easily talk myself out of a work out because I would be too tired from work and school and did not want to dedicate another 2 hours to go to the gym. My dad always convinced me that cardio was the way to go (he is a marathon runner and my biggest trainer/motivation) but I was just not having it from him. I started to get discouraged with not seeing results and not being able to maintain my stamina like how I was back in high school so I stopped going to the gym for a period of like 6-8 months. This is when I gained my most weight and I was the heaviest I've ever been. My friend from work started mentioning this camp and how it's all about cardio and some form of toning and weight lifting (in my mind I was thinking cross fit and I cannot stand that idea of working out). I was skeptic at first and wanted to see how it was going to go within the 28 day challenge. I attended both morning and evening classes for the 28 days and started to eat healthier. I lost a total of 17 pounds within the challenge and I'm telling you I'm not stopping there. I signed up for 6 months and I can guarantee you that every dollar is worth it. Trust the process and I can promise you with such an AMAZING environment, group of people, and amazing coaches, you become the person you want to be and even more. This will become a lifestyle and you'll end up being more confident in everything that you do.  ",JNnUhC2Og7_efYPOWkXgAA,Daisy C.,90280

This review is not by a meat head that loves shitty gyms or slams weights on the ground and mean mugs people. I'm just sick of reading moronic reviews by people that can barley construct a sentence. This is an awesome no frills gym. Free weights downstairs and a boxing ring with several bags and speed bags available. Cheapest personal boxing training that you'll find anywhere. I've trained with Josh for a month and he's been knowledgable and accommodating to my schedule. Upstairs there are treadmills, stair masters, spin and yoga rooms and child care from what I've been told. They don't have changing rooms yet. That is the only realistic drawback. I'm not sure what there is to complain about here, a dirty window sill and a dead fly? Your feelings got hurt when you asked a $20 a month gym if they had a sauna? Get over yourself. If you want a place to work out or get your cardio in for a good price you won't beat this place.

The remodel sucks! First they didn't notify of any remodeling happening. Second, there is no space in between the machines now. Third, only 2 treadmills work. It's pretty annoying. Even before the remodel all the treadmills sucked except for one. Yeah your only paying $20 a month but if your looking for a gym to join; skip this one. Only two staff members are friendly, the rest are always on their phone and rude. And to top it off to cancel your membership, you have to send a letter, you can't cancel it at the gym itself. The same place where you sign up to start your gym membership. And I know I'm not the only one unhappy with the changes because the gym itself is empty half the times now, maybe due to the fact that half the machines don't work.

We have been members at the gym for over 1 year. That is until today. My wife and daughters were asked to leave. In most situations the management are the ones that smooth things over. This was not the case. Not only is the manager of questionable integrity so is the owner. NEWS FLASH! North Hollywood is a diverse city. If you don't like different ethnicities you should probably move your gym to another state. The owner and management are without a doubt racist. I actually spoke to one of your employees and he agreed that an 11yr old and 13yr old were not doing anything wrong. I must also emphasize the #1 reason we purchased the memberships is they claimed and boasted about a family friendly environment. What a LIE that turned out to be. It's obvious who the owner/manager voted for this last presidential election. Who knows maybe they will start hiring immigration officers at personal trainers.

I originally went in for one class, and walked away with a one month pass. I really should have only bought one class.  I tried three different teachers, and they each had three very different styles of practicing.  The feeling I got more than anything is that the instructors were practicing yoga and you were welcome to practice alongside them. Instruction was minimal. Adjustments were nonexistent. I don't know why it's billed as a hot yoga place because it definitely doesn't get that hot.  Maybe warm yoga?

What's great is that no 2 workouts are alike, which means your every part of your body gets worked out and the results are real! Take me for example, I started the the program in late July, early August of 2010 and from the time I started to about mid September I saw and felt the results. Like most people though I also had trouble with my eating which was really bad! Sodas and junk food every day and I was pushing almost 300 lbs. No Joke! In September of 2010 I started an 8-week program with Stadium Fitness' dietitian and at the end of the 8 weeks I had lost over 30 lbs. But it didn't stop there, I felt so good about myself that I decided to go from twice a week to 3 times a week to train with David. Now I attend 4-5 times a week and have lost so much more weight that NONE of my clothes even fit anymore. I bought a few things to wear late last year and now those clothes are too big now.

While at first I could barely run one tunnel from the field to the top now I can do 6.  My core is stronger.  I have muscle definition! My stamina is back.  I play tennis and now I can get to balls that I could never have dreamt of getting to before Stadium Fitness.  And the icing on the cake...I've lost so many pounds and inches that I had to get new clothes.  Stadium Fitness has been a life-changer.  I feel fitter and healthier than I've been in years and I've met some incredible people along the way.  Funny thing is, now I LOVE running those stairs and sprinting on the field.  And, I'm not the only one who has had this experience with Stadium Fitness.  YA GOTTA COME OUT AND TRY IT!!  There's nothing, nothing like working out INSIDE the Rose Bowl with awesome trainers and great people.",Zi4hD4kXkoAjYFwaWSUt8Q,Vannia D.,91103

Before that it was all cardio and that's how I thought people got abs. Obviously that's not true but whatever. Paul is legitimately the only trainer I've had that has fixed my form when working out. What does that mean? Before Paul I thought lunges were super easy. With him I realised that they were about 75% harder because turns out I wasn't doing it right. Basically every single workout you do counts with him. Even if you do like 10 sit ups they'll be the best ten sit ups ever. And the results show. Also I get whiney if I'm tired/annoyed etc and he is good with dealing with that too which is a plus.Always fab training with him,C3O-pRr49jKIiQjtM_pybg,Anwesha K.,90017

He's also a great person who's easy and fun to be around, so the sessions go by quickly and are truly enjoyable (such a plus when you're tired and dragging!).

When I met Paul for a consult he was so cool and nice and I thought I hope our schedules work out because he has to be my trainer. Lucky me it did! I also have awful posture like sway back hunched shoulders - a whole mess. He showed me what proper posture was. It took 26 years but I'm finally standing correctly and getting the right back muscles activated so thank you Paul!! Also I have no core and in no time he was getting my abs engaged and firing. So in summary Paul is an amazing guy, motivating but not intimidating, and makes working out fun. Also he is all about correct alignment and posture during workouts so you're in amazing hands.

In our first session, I felt instantly comfortable and inspired, and his vast knowledge along with the sense of care for what he does, made me feel confident for the first time in my life that it was possible for me to reach a very big weight loss goal. He taught me about nutrition and how to eat well, he kept me motivated, and our sessions were always super informative, really fun and entertaining. I never enjoyed exercising or working out before I started training, and I was seeing the way my body would be transforming week after week, and looking forward to my sessions with Paul because he's genuinely an awesome dude who keeps it real and knows a LOT, not just about fitness and how to help you reach your goals, but about life in general with a positive outlook whose given me some very valuable insights on a lot of things - and in the time I spent training with Paul, he helped me lose 80 pounds!!!

He did running, weights and boxing with me and taught me so much about exercising and eating. He taught me how to crush the speed bag and also how to workout and stretch for my body type and any pain I was having. He is also just a good dude who is fun to talk to. He was very patient with me even when I was having tired days or didn't eat my best. He even ran a 5k with me super early on a Saturday morning to help encourage my new running hobby.

He listens, understands, motivates and can read people so he knows when to push, not to push, how to support and what to offer when challenged, plus, he really knows his profession - exercise (including corrective and preventive,) the body, nutrition, etc. He changes things up continually to keep workouts fun and he sees things he knows he can help improve that you may not even be aware of, posture being a common one. Taking it further though, I have an issue with balance and tree pose in yoga was a nightmare. I thought it was just something I will always struggle with, but Paul quietly kept having me do exercises that unbeknown to me actually greatly improved my balance. Working with Paul for the past 3.5+ years has been a rewarding and important part of my well-being. Also, he is one hell of a landscape photographer.",PmgqPDFm_lKTy6bZQj3DNw,Janet L.,90017

There was a blob of fat and a blob of muscle (fake of course) laying out on the table to illustrate the difference in density/size, but thankfully I didn't get any sort of ""informative talk"" either when I picked them up.

After moving to Hollywood a couple of years ago, I tried a lot of studios to find one that I liked--but they all felt really processed and contrived and I almost gave up on yoga altogether. Then about six months ago, I discovered Siesta Yoga right in my neighborhood near Griffith Park. From day one I felt completely welcomed and at home at this studio. It's a great space with great energy, and Brandee and Christian are caring and incredible teachers who know exactly how to help each individual student achieve a beautiful practice. I usually attend Christian's ashtanga class, and I always feel amazing by the end of it...and the longer I practice the better I feel! Seriously, after a few months of consistent practice I can feel both my body and mind becoming stronger and healthier. The teachers at Siesta Yoga reminded me what it is that I love about yoga, and I think they could do the same for anyone who walks through their doors. I highly recommend this studio for anyone who wants to experience yoga the way it should be--empowering, healing, and fun!",XG2sV4O--vavNwWnOmhWyg,Becca G.,90027

They will teach you how to kick, punch, block, spar the correct way. If you want to lose weight, get toned, or start competing, this place will teach it all. The facility is big and clean. They have on site showers and bathrooms. If you're animal lovers, this gym has the cutest doggies there in the office! :) The staff and fellow gym members are super friendly and helpful. I've lost 6 lb in a month from taking Muay Thai classes and lifting the weights they have. The conditioning class and Muay Thai boxing is extremely effective for weight loss, strength and endurance. and Jit Jitsu is great for self-defense as well as fitness. But you gotta commit to yourself and come to the gym at least twice a week! I brought my best friend to take classes with me and she loves it!

The class consists of women at different physical fitness levels. She is very supportive and always helps you get through whatever obstacles you encounter each session. She also started the elite bootcamp program which doesn't strictly focus on Muay Thai but allows you to focus on the areas you choose to work on after each 1 hour session. I pretty much love this bootcamp class for the variety. I love that we spend time on the mat learning Muay Thai but we can also spend time circuit training. Each class is different which helps keep you on your toes and prevents you from getting bored! I always leave satisfied dripping in sweat from the great workout.

This place is ok but I have seen better.  The bJJ teachers all really know their stuff.  Robbie, Leo and Dave are all very helpful, inspiring instructors who answer all your questions.  Tim is very technically proficient but sometimes a bit smug.  The teaching of technique is very good but they throw too many techniques at beginners.  They give you 150 techniques to learn for blue belt.  The Gracie method seems a little more effective where they have you learn the most important fundamental techniques thoroughly before you take on more techniques.",S9EDxdqf0I4U0hfnhTPzcw,Casting L.,90025

I am so happy I decided to give this place a try three months ago. This was exactly what I had been looking for. First of all this has helped jump start my weight loss of 10 pounds and counting. Britt's workouts are a great mixture of cardio, strength training  and Muy Thai Technique. Every class is different and she keeps you wanting to come back. I look forward to her classes because I know I'll be getting a killer workout. I have only been a member for a short time but my Muy Thai technique has improved so much and each class I continue to learn. There is a sense of community and camaraderie that is very special and unique. I have made friends and really appreciate the coaches. As much as I enjoy our class sizes now, it would be selfish to not want other women to experience this awesome program. Give it a try and you will see !",CqRsXrArStGaQ2Ro47w4Lg,Christine M.,90025

To come and hang out with friends multiple times a week and see marked improvement in my fitness and skill-set is worth the monthly fee. I've noticed some reviewers that are frustrated about price, but this gym isn't for people who are trying to replace 24-Hour Fitness. Robot is serious and so are the people who join and stay members.

Relatively clean environment (some of the places I trained I left feeling like I wanted to burn my GI.) and of course #6. Near my house on the west side...

He will also answer any question you have about techniques or even jiu-jitsu philosophy, no matter how dumb it might be (""so, I should be cross-facing him when I put him in side control?"") The beginner's class that he teaches is extremely helpful, as the instructors go through every detail you'll need to advance in skill level (with fine details that are often overlooked by most instructors). Holes in your jiu-jitsu game WILL be filled in. The instructors even use a move program so you don't come in one day with half guard training and the next day with full-mount drills.

BUT, once the wedding was over, and we got back from lounging on our honeymoon, life quickly became busy. While we were trying to maintain healthy eating habits, getting to the gym was rough. We were too tired. Eventually we got motivation to go, 3-5 times a week. We thought we were doing great. Unfortunately, we just weren't getting the results we wanted. We were stuck. I had seen Robot daily. It's in our neighborhood and I pass it during my commute. I was curious about it, but it seemed intimidating- fight & fitness? I'm not exactly the fighting type. However, a LivingSocial deal came up for the Women's Boot Camp class. It was the perfect excuse to try it out. A sign, if you will. When I went for my orientation, I was really excited to work out there. Everyone was so close-knit, it was like family. It's a small space but has enough room to kick some butt. I signed my husband and I both up for membership. 2-3 classes a week w/ access to the gym/weights. Within the first 2 weeks we were noticing results. Being a guy, my husband saw results faster. Which is so not fair! But I was happy that we were getting back in shape. Like many reviewers, I was sore- I am sore! I find that I am sore in a different place after each class. Coach Brittany makes you work. Hard. She makes sure to tailor to your needs and weaknesses. I'm in much better shape and my endurance has dramatically improved since the beginning of June. I attend both the Women's Boot Camp ,and the Saturday Coed Fitness & Conditioning. Boot Camp provides a great mix of Muay Thai and cardio. I am finding that I like the fight part a lot more than I thought I would. Getting some stress out on the bag is awesome, but learning/improving technique is really cool. The Fitness & Conditioning helps build my strength, and makes me push myself. ",vAmG3lR-JWz7IePM3m1V6A,Sarah C.,90025

The only reason that i'm not still training there now is because I'm ready to get into the ring and with my schedule I relocated to a smaller gym with a larger percentage of fighters training there.  This allows me to spar and train with active professional and amateur fighters almost regularly where as the student body at Robot is a broader base with not as many active fighters.  I'm sure that if my schedule would have allowed me to train with Huerta I could have found the training I sought but you gotta do what you gotta do.  I am glad to have found Robot and I'm confident that I'll be back training there again in the future as my journey continues.  Oh I almost forgot...they also have a nice strength and conditioning program run by Justin Zhang.  He's always taken great care of me since first meeting him a few years ago.  I've stayed on their email list just to keep up with the happenings in the Robot Fight Fitness world.  If you're looking to introduce or deepen your experience in grappling, striking or strength & conditioning you'll be glad to get on the mat with these folks.  Good people.  Best of luck out there!  Oooosssss!",8070gsXgCF_jT3bFrO9y7g,Charles L.,90025

The way the program works is that you spend about two weeks on a particular topic, such as side control or wrestling and learn a variety of techniques related to said topic. Each class starts with a very brief warm-up (I try to warm up on my own time) so that they can maximize instruction. You then learn about two techniques per class before going into both positional and normal sparring. It's an excellent format which I have found to be quite conducive to the learning experience.

After being showed and explained the posture, you are given all the time you need to repeat it, which is truly the best way to get better at the right pace for your body.

You truly feel like a member of the family working out with them. Their tag team style of class leading puts them in their own class right along side you.  In the world of fitness you have plenty of choices. Why choose someone who hasn't lived the life?  Both Ray and Rachel have been at competition level and know what it takes to get there.  They will take their time with you with one on one sessions or group classes. I just had my first one on one class with Ray and man do I feel it. Since I started training years ago I've been solely focused on lifting monster weight and build as much muscle as possible. Because of this I've had many injuries and have lost my ability to be flexible and limber. The session with Ray was almost completely body weight movements that brought muscles that I had never even known to exist into play. As I'm typing this it has been about 12 hours since the end of my session and I'm still feeling burn. I'm super excited about my decision to have Ray train me. I look forward to making progress and getting into the best shape of my life. With Ray and Rachel's help I know I can get there. ",r3s2a7FkDw7dayrQgNZxTw,AR D.,91506

The studio itself is beautiful and extremely spacious, so even when attendance is high, it never feels cramped or crowded.

A thousand points for hygge. The facilities are excellent. The staff is sort of zen and will usually whisper when they speak to you so it feels like you're sharing a secret with them and the other 20-ish people in the weeknight classes. The main hot room faces the street, but some clever witchcraft makes it tough for casual passers-by to gawk at the sweaty limbs attempting garudasana with varying degrees of success. The exposed brick and high ceilings facilitate focus and meditation. If you find yourself with an instructor who's not your cup of tea (I've gotten a couple of these here) then definitely come back again and take a class with Stella H or Rob Z or Steve Arcos because they are really wonderful (and/or someone else who hasn't made it into my rotation yet but is probably awesome).

I love it.  Went in for the drop in deal 10$ and ended up immediately signing myself up for the one month unlimited introductory package.  I actually think I'm going to stick this out, because  it must be something about hot yoga that is working for me.  I was suspicious of it first and it frankly sounded off putting, and was imagining  sweating with a bunch of perfectly sculpted models in bathing suits  but, it's not at all. It's very comfortable and natural. Once you get going you beggin to embrace it and the heat feels actually really soothing.  Aside from that, the instructors are really good, I took an introductory class with Lexi, and absolutely loved It . The class is listed  as a breathing/ stretching class on the schedule , but it's a gentle introduction to yoga. Although I have been dabbling  with yoga for a while, it's easy to forget the drill if u haven't done it for a bit, and so many instructors don't take the time  to  show you the fundamentals. This class is perfect for that.  Overall the environment is  really nice,  not pretentiousness .  It's super clean, spacious, easy to find parking,  the introductory rate is very very affordable. And so is the one time drop in rate. ",9vHxb5yo1FrM6iDD-wFLJg,Noodle C.,90042

On my first class I set my mat down right next to a puddle of either sweat or water. I stepped in it and told the instructor. She seemed unfazed by it. During the class I did not receive much help in the way of posture. They assume you know most of the moves and how to do them. I was clearly struggling with a few even though this I've been doing yoga on and off for years and wasn't given any help.

After being a member for 6 months, I moved and thought this Club Pilates location was too far from me, so I decided I should end my membership. The classes are fine and generic. Pilates in general is great for your body, especially helping those with lower back pain like myself. What I want to write about is the management and this club's frigid customer service. I was not told about the 30-day notice needed to leave the club, so I ended up paying for December even though I knew I would not be able to go while out of town for the holidays and moving when I returned. After moving into my new place, I learned that there were no other pilates reformer classes near me. Even though it is a 30-minute drive, because of my lower back issues, I tried to sign up for the Club Pilates Echo Park location. I called for 2 1/2 weeks and played phone tag with the manager and a gaggle of people on the phone. I simply wanted to know if I could enroll at the same $200/month rate that I had locked in before my move. It had been less than 2 weeks since my membership had ended. I finally went in person only to find that the manager would not even consider going back to my the rate. The manager treated me like a peasant for even asking. I wish I had just been told this over the phone because I wasted an hour of my day just getting there to hear this when I have chronic back pain. I guess having to pay for December, not being given the option to freeze my account, not being told about the 30-day notice since it's in the fine print, and then -- when trying to sign up again only 2 weeks after ending -- well, I admit some that's on me. But, after six months of going consistently, I'd wish for some freaking humanity. Where's the fine print that protects the customer? So much for customer service and caring about the actual person instead of just $$$$. And, the parking is terrible.",ZNMu5JHsK5NEhp84HGhhmw,Josephine G.,90026

I purchased a Gilt City voucher for 10 classes, and am glad I did (and that I got such a good deal!). The classes are certainly challenging, and I can see that it takes a few classes to get used to the technique and using completely new muscles (for me, at least), but that just makes me want to continue going and improving! Most of the other people in the class seemed to know what they were doing, but the instructors have been really friendly and attentive, and help you improve your technique/form throughout the class. One of the clases I went to was specifically for beginners, and they went through all the components of class a bit more slowly and thoroughly, which I found really helpful. Best of all, that class is FREE! So it did not detract from my 10 classes. I believe it's held once a month, and it's definitely worth going for those who are new to barre. The instructor answered questions along the way and made sure everyone was performing the exercises correctly, which I appreciated. Will definitely be coming back to Pure Barre, most likely beyond my 10 voucher classes!",u5l0NyqTkosFwtPtBb9dMg,Corey I.,90025

During valet hours you get 90min free parking with validation. During off hours it's all free. I also love the fact that they offer early morning and late evening classes (Meryl's 6:20am classes FTW!). Having a busy work schedule it's hard to find time for working out so being able to go in early in the morning or after work is great. I haven't tried all of the instructors but I love all of the ones I've had classes with. I do have my favorites (Meryl, Brittany, Alison and Jennifer are awesome) but all the other ones are also great! The classes are fast-paced and really challenging which is my favorite part. I love that the instructors always mix it up and do different exercises so it never feels like you're doing the same thing over and over. They also always have some kind of promotion going on at the studio, especially for unlimited classes, which makes it easier to afford.

I had one of the worst experiences at Pure Barre in Brentwood and will never go back. I bought a class online, which you pay for ahead of time, then the night of the class came to park and got stuck in a standstill in the parking lot. Cars were not moving and the parking attendents ignored me and continued their conversation when I asked what was going on (after 15 minutes of not moving). When I finally pulled up they told me to find street parking. I searched for near 20 minutes in the area, driving blocks away, only to find no parking. At this point, the class had already been going for 15 minutes. I would think 30 minutes would be enough to park when they say they have a lot for you to park in. I left feeling incredibly frustrated that I had paid for the class and missed it because they had no available parking. Then Pure Barre charged me anADDITIONAL $25 for missing the class. That is on top of the $25 I had already paid. They charged me $50 and told me they couldn't refund me. What HORRIBLE business practice. Not only will I never be returning, I will be telling all my clients this story.

I feel so at home at PB Brentwood...and that isn't because I have made friends with the staff/customers...I come alone most of the time and don't socialize...but still feel at home and very welcomed. Each work out is slightly different so your body doesn't get used to the routine....aka...you're always working something new/different and feeling the burn!

Being in my mid 30's with career and family to balance - I've never found a more efficient way to see my butt, legs and abs react. One month unlimited package. All body types in class.

I don't know if it has to do with it being on the second floor of a shopping center in the corner but it gets uncomfortably warm during a workout. I live closer to this location but opt for the Santa Monica location because I know my workout will be more enjoyable with some mild air conditioning.

In the last 7 years, I can say I 've spinned almost every day. I've tried a few spinning classes around Los Angeles, and I am a connoisseur of the fine ""spin"". If Soul Cycle was a fine wine, it would be scored above 90 points. It kicks ass. You will come out of there sweaty, and every muscle will be worked to a point you didn't think  you could achieve, you will also walk out there with your head high and shoulders back because you pushed yourself to do better. I highly recommend Angela Davis' classes, she knows how to get the most of each rider, being a professional athlete and trainer she is cognizant of each rider's abilities and makes each ride tailored for you.  For those who need to go straight to work from SC, there are two showers in each restroom, towels, and plenty of product.

However, a friend of mine asked me to be her guest at her ""beloved soul"" class at the butt-crack-of-dawn this past Saturday morning...and though I questioned both of our sanity for waking up before 7 on a weekend by choice, I couldn't turn her down. The studio is nice - I like that it's bright, that they offer complimentary shoes, hair ties and earplugs and I definitely sensed a strong community. I thought it was going to be more pretentious, but the people all seem cool. My spin instructor, ANGELA, is apparently all the rage (she gets 5 stars!) and let me tell you, she took this jewish gal to church! The ride was really hard and really inspiring. Angela gave all of us lots of motivation and I needed it to get through some of those hill climbs. It definitely felt like it was longer than 45 minutes. I left drenched from head to toe (which was from a combination of the intensity of the workout and the fact that they keep it extremely hot in the spin room) and invigorated. My biggest 2 gripes are: the music is so damn loud (and even though I had earplugs in, it's a gnarly distraction once you start sweating and the earplugs start sliding out) and the crazy price. Would I ever come back? Yes! Regularly? No. I appreciate the down-to-earthness of other studios that offer just as good of a sweat sesh and unlimited monthly plans.",_J5s_YGEed_ZJvxeYdCeOg,Jesse P.,90069

I haven't been to a cycling class since last summer and I had so much fun getting back at it. Ben uses such awesome music when spinning and is also strictly a positive motivator. The previous spin classes I went to at my old gym would have this instructor that would negatively call out it's ""spinners"", it was so embarrassing, but Ben doesn't do that at all! The only ""eh"" thing about the class is that the bikes are really really REALLY close together, but I honestly only cared about that when we would do outer arm push ups when spinning and my elbows would touch the girl next to me (happened like twice.)

I typically go to Yas but I have also been to Flywheel and a few other places. I must say, the class I went to in west hollywood is WAY TOO INTENSE. End of the day, I loved the class but I don't think the music needs to be THAT LOUD. The teacher was amazing. The students were very into the dance moves. I can see we were all in it to win it. HOWEVER, it absolutely made me feel like a lunatic for being there and that's not a good feeling. When the teacher are saying these ""inspirational"" thoughts, it is great but half of the time I can't hear my own thoughts since the music is too loud. I think soulcycle is a treat type of place. You should definitely go there once in a while. Maybe for your birthday, on the weekend, etc. It is not for everyday. I don't want to feel like a lunatic everyday.

But seriously, after every single class I never regret going because you feel so good about yourself after. And it can be a bit intimidating because there are some pros in there but the teachers make sure you feel safe and you're doing everything correctly. They really look for quality over quantity.

I had tried everything from Pilates to Wundabar, working out a 24 hour fitness, training for races, boot camp, everything! And nothing has gotten me as excited and motivated about my fitness as Crossfit Array has. Also no other work out has given me the results that crossfit has. I can honestly saw I am in the best shape I have ever been in!  I was intimidated at first being a girl and thinking that crossfit was mostly male dominated, but after my first class I knew I had nothing to worry about. The instructors are amazing and they really personalize the work outs to you, ensuring that you are comfortable and are not doing anything that would put you in danger of getting hurt. They set goals for you and assist you along every step of the way to make sure you get the results you are looking for! And as far as price, it may seem a little expensive at first but it is worth every penny. You really get your money's worth with the flexible work out schedule and personal attention you receive. Plus it is one of the more affordable crossfit gyms I have seen compared to others in the area. Everyone who is a member there is really nice and welcoming, making it really easy to fit right in.

Sometimes you've got to hear something a different way for it to click, and solid coaching comes down to understanding how your athletes learn and adjusting to that, and I have experienced nothing but that from every coach since joining Strange.

I have had a few different ""home base"" gyms, and I've dropped in at over a dozen. This is the best CrossFit gym that I've been to. It has everything that an athlete of any level needs to maintain or drastically improve physical health and performance. Sam is the best coach that I know. As the head coach at Strange, she writes workouts that will challenge athletes of all levels. What I love about her approach is that it's great for people just getting started (in CrossFit or just in fitness in general), but it will also push strong and experienced athletes to new heights. The workouts incorporate all the basic CrossFit movements, and Sam loves to give us high-skill and high-weight workouts that many gyms shy away from. She and the rest of the coaches always know how to make the most of your time at the gym. They stress good form and movement so that you can push yourself while knowing that you're safe. They work with you if you have an injury or weakness. They encourage you and help you progress toward movements and tasks that you probably didn't think you were capable of. On top of all this, the space is excellent. There is so much room that you never feel crowded, regardless of what equipment you need. All the equipment is new and top-of-the-line. There is plenty of parking. The coaches and members are all people who you'll look forward to spending time with. They have a mobility and stretching class to help you stay loose, balanced, and moving well. I could probably list more positive things about Strange, but this is already long enough that you probably stopped reading a few lines back. So, if you're still reading, come see for yourself! This place is welcoming, unpretentious, positive, and fun!",I8zdsBtpOg5dYJ6dtYc1ew,Vince O.,91605

The atmosphere is great everyone is friendly and welcoming (I brought my sister who has never tried crossfit before and she enjoys it and doesn't feel left out or intimidated by the experienced members).

Though I was a professional dancer and used to be very active up until a few years ago, after starting grad school in architecture, my lifestyle, alignment, and habits all took a dive... Long story short, I ended up with a back injury which got worse and led to me having to have spine surgery. The injury obviously had prevented me from exercising, and I ended up gaining a lot of weight. Post surgery, I really needed a trainer who was well versed in all aspects of fitness, not just rehab, not just weight loss. I needed someone that was knowledgeable enough to help me achieve major weight loss while also knowing how to help me do it in a safe and injury-free way (which  is rarer than one may think in the world of personal trainers, they're usually one extreme or the other). Sam was the guy.... though I couldn't continue training because I'm not yet fully healed from surgery the way I need to be in order to train (this is not due to my workouts with Sam, this is due to me returning to my grueling school schedule two weeks post-op), for the time that I did train with him, he was amazingly understanding of my condition, yet he also pushed me enough to take me out of my comfort zone and keep me motivated!! That's exactly what you need with a trainer, someone that pushes you to your max potential, but is also sensitive and understands what you're going through so that you feel safe and comfortable with the person training you.

Instead, All Out Effort gives everyone a personalized routine, but first looks at the bigger picture -- what do you eat, how do you sleep, do you drink enough water daily, are you stressed -- so that you see physical fitness as a part of overall well-being. Then, when it comes to physical training, AOE starts with basic mobility (a problem area for me) to get clients flexible before it's time for strength training. To be sure, I've seen some amazingly fit clients training there, but what matters to me is that after a few weeks I was able to walk and carry things much more effortlessly, because for years my muscles had been fighting their own stiffness without me knowing it.  I also had balance issues, so they focused on balance exercises -- embarrassing in front of others what with all the falling over, but over time I got better. The AOE staff are cheery and pleasant. No tough-talking jocks here. Sam in particular is an intellectual who can and will enthusiastically discuss any brainy topic while correcting your form.

I almost didn't sign up with him because his interviewing of me was so rigorous that I was afraid he was going to be one of those ""yell at you"" types of trainers. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Sam is very much about showing you a path, and you deciding if you want to walk the path.He's supportive, and somewhat chill, but if it becomes clear you aren't interested in putting effort in, he'd rather refund your money and have you find a trainer that works better for you. Sam is paleo, but you don't have to be. Whatever you choose to follow will be respected so long as you are choosing what you do vs just ambling along eating junk food or jumping on a fad. My choosing to train with him was not so much about weight loss, but improving my mobility and strength. The workouts are not simply an hour, because your warm-up mobility exercises will take you at least 20-30 minutes before you begin the workout. There are three trainers in the operation: Sam, Michelle, and Cindy. Their styles are different, but you won't go wrong with any of them (Cindy is the toughest!).  After I moved away from LA, I tried a gym & trainer in my location that ""seemed"" like Sam's place -- seemed to have the same philosophy and the same type of exercises. But it was an awful fit for me. The key is not just the exercises you do, its finding the right kind of mentor -- and that's what they are. If you enjoy your exercise you'll stick with it.

If you're on the sides or in the corners its incredibly hard to see the teacher and in some cases you're staring at a door instead of a mirror. This makes it hard to check form or see what's going on since the teacher is obscured by other riders. Part of what makes Soul so great is the personal connection you can feel with the teachers, but in a room this big, that's lost if you're anywhere other than the front row middle, or side bar front row.

Can't say enough about his knowledge, attentiveness and the results he provides. I played sports and lifted weights growing up, but I've always been more of a skinny guy and wanted to beef up my strength and muscle gains to show off a little and move up a weight class in martial arts. I learned that power and Olympic lifts were the best way to do this, so after asking around I was told by several people he was the one to talk to. I worked with him for 3-4 months and saw a huge transformation in my body physique and strength. He was always dialed in on my form and knew exactly how to cue me to help correct it when I'd start to fail. More importantly, he helped me find the appropriate amount of exercise, rest and recovery that I need for my specific goals and body type, which plays a critical role in strength and muscle gains. Having worked with several other trainers before and after him, I can say he is definitely one of the best I've had the pleasure working with. I shattered all of my personal bests and outgrew all of my clothes by at least a full size. I had to buy a new wardrobe and couldn't be more pleased with how I looked popping out of my shirts! Haha. He really listens to what you want and customizes everything to what you NEED, (whether you like it or not!) which I think is why we pay all that money that we do in the first place.",bRycHHiuvIdne2OIWVaPDg,Juan E.,90012

Crossfit is like driving a car, you do it everyday, high reps, it ends up becoming muscle memory. These functional movements become muscle memory. I do a squat when I pick something up. Evoke offers so many classes at every frame of the day, there isn't a reason to miss a class. It comes down to this gang, Crossfit Evoke is building your body back up to where you were as a child, its reprogramming every muscle fiber. They say Crossfit doesn't emphasize flexibility, Evoke does. They say Crossfit doesn't care about form and technique, Evoke does, If Esther catches you lifting with your back, or not getting low enough in a squat, better be sure you'll hear about it. Crossfit is to high intensity for you? Evoke scales every workout to your capability while still challenging you. I can't imagine any box being better equipped, (they have so many toys!).

And the gate to enter the lot has a 4 digit passcode that they've failed to communicate anywhere on the site or Classpass. They don't even pick up their phone. I've called several times because I couldn't find the lot or even the place rather, but noone picks up. So unless you're psychic to guess the code right, and have alot of free time on your hands to just circle around the block 7 times guessing which parking lot is theirs, this place is a total waste of time. Arriving at the place should not be this difficult so right off the bat that's a -10. I get there and they say grip socks are required to enter class which they follow up with saying they could be bought for $14 which is pretty ridiculous.  They should've been more flexible with first timers but they weren't and sent me home without any questions asked and that was my first class. Don't waste your time here. There's far better pilates places with quality instructors, who are far more friendlier, give you the utmost convenience for the money you pay, give out socks to rent to make it easy, and just simply far better customer service.

I was struggling, and the guy was also.  The teacher kept demonstrating things that no one (not even the girl who was really good) could do (and yes, it was amazing to see her do that... but I wasn't there to ""watch"").  Eventually she did help me and the guy modify some of the exercises, but in general I didn't feel that was she really paying attention to the class until we were about 35 min in, then she began to notice I wasn't able to do some of the exercises.  I've taken classes at 2 other studios, and most teachers seem to be pretty aware of beginners and really helpful, so this class pissed me off!  As a result, I'll never go back there, which is too bad, since I'm sure there are other teachers who are much better... but I'd rather find a studio where ALL the teachers at least pay attention to the students.",dqLhJkeSbu5J1KHKyD-QZg,C O.,90028

The workout was very intense. I do not recommend it for anyone who does not consider themselves strong. I am really looking forward to building my strength and stamina through yoga, cardio, and weight training (or easier pilates classes), and then making Mikael's class a regular weekly thing. Mikael was intimidating yet encouraging. His presence pushes you to your absolute max capacity. But he really takes the time to guide each individual in the movements, making very frequent adjustments which I loved. He is very efficient and quick, always thinking ahead so you can anticipate the next move. I parked on the street right in front but they do have a parking lot.

I've taken hundred of different classes at tons of different studios and never hated one before this one. As soon as I walked in the door Mikael says ""have you been here before?"" I said ""No but I've done Pilates before"" he promptly informs me that they do NOT teach Pilates here. OKKKKKayyyyy... you might want to think about removing the word PILATES from the name of your business if that's NOT what you do. They teach Lagree whatever the eff that is. But ok Fine, I'm willing to try something new, but Mikael was clearly not interested in teaching. Even though there was only three other girls in class he was already visibly annoyed that I was new. He spent the next hour giving me half assed, barely intelligible instructions and then coming over to berate me when I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be doing. I'm not a workout newbie but you would think that if there was a new student you would try to give clearer instructions. After verbally berating me didn't seem to be working (because I couldn't understand what he was saying), he proceeded to roughly grab me and force me into the ""correct"" positions. I've been doing yoga and pilates for 15 years and have had a personal trainer so I'm used to having my form corrected, but I have never had a instructor grab me this way. When I told him I couldn't do a movement because there was too much resistance with multiple springs he looked me dead in the eye and said ""if you don't want to do it, don't do it"". Look dude, first of all, I didn't say I DIDN'T WANT to do it and second of all, what he EFF is your problem??? Most REASONABLE instructors would say ""ok why don't you try removing 1 spring and do the best you can."" That's ALL that needed to be said in that situation but instead he decided to get in my face about it. I came close to walking out right then and there. Never have I even contemplated walking out of a class but this guy was pushed me to the edge that much. I did my best (which apparently wasn't nearly good enough for Mikael) for the rest of class but I was counting down the minutes until I could put as much distance as possible between me and this horrible studio.

,1330 N Highland Ave,4.5,Pilates,Pilates Platinum,117,3,Hollywood,8/19/2018,"Angie was nice, lots of good burns in the hamstrings and core, but compared to SLT and Brooklyn Bodyburn, it wasn't that great (just moved here). It was more like traditional pilates, I think we only did 3-4 real Lagree moves. The machines were older megaformers that didn't have the moving bar used for extended skating or straps for balance on the front and back, which was weird to get used to. There were no handles on the front or back platforms either so I don't think this studio does a lot of mountain climbers and cardio bursts there. Music wasn't quite loud or energetic enough. I was going to go back a few times and give it another try but then when I asked if my son could sit against the wall with his iPad in the future (single mom life) they said no, and I only join studios that are family friendly like SLT was, so I won't be back.",dHGcxcusIBpCc1KsKQOkTw,Nicole D.,90028

There are only classes ranging from 10-30 people in a class, so you start to become a family and bond with each other. It's a mix of weightlifting and cardio, and the workouts are different daily. I get bored easily, so this was a bonus for me. Additionally, Ditanyon sat down with me and went over my nutrition and came up with a plan for me to sustain. Since joining, I have lost nearly 20lbs, 8% body fat and inches everywhere. I am more toned and stronger, as well as my mental health has also improved.

My fiance and I wanted to find a bootcamp that we could go to to help get fit for our wedding. We signed up for this gym and that gym but we tended to find more reasons not to go to the gym then to go. Plus every time we went, we always did the same boring workout (a little cardio, some weights, some abs and then home) We came across Tru Fit and decided to give it a try using a two week voucher they were offering on yelp. Well thats all history now. Its been two months and we signed a year contract membership. If that doesn't tell you how much we love this place let me break it down: Ditanyon (owner and lead trainer) changes the routine every single class. In his words, it keeps your muscles guessing and keeps the classes from becoming boring. Ditayon is not just a trainer who kicks your ass, (believe me you feel worked at the end of every class - don't let his Easy Tuesday speech fool you) but he provides important information about nutrition, and technique. Most importantly, he's NOT a crazy steroid using crossfit guy. I tried a crossfit once and it reaffirmed why I didn't join the military. I don't particularly like to be yelled at and belittled. Moreover, the instructor never took a lot of time to break down the exercises and ensure I wasn't hurting myself.  Tru Fit is just the opposite. Ditanyon pushes you but his method revolves around encouragement and praise. This approach makes me want to do better. Not just for myself, but as a thank you to him for pushing me, providing the space for me to accomplish my goals and educating me on nutrition and form so I don't hurt myself.

I became familiar with this gym and the great reviews so was excited when a few days later Groupon featuerd a $39 voucher for 10 sessions at Tru FIt Boot Camp.  It was required that I first come to an orientation/assessment. I scheduled for Dec 19th, (over a month ago) I was the only person that arrived, so the young gentlemen/trainer ran me through a sample of what the classes would entail- it was challenging, but I got the idea of what a cross fit class is like. After this 30 minute private sample he brought me into the office and began (as I quickly detected) to sell me on a membership. Honestly, I was surprised  a reputable gym would ever want to sell a membership without a person actually taking a proper class! Joining a gym is actually a big commitment - both personal and financial and should not be entered into lightly. So,  after I recovered from a small arm surgery I returned this week. I had one class with a young lady in the morning, there were about 7 other people present, a small but good class. I left feeling invigorated and ready to try another class. I returned two days later for another morning class but different instructor, so I could better gauge the range of instructors. I informed the person at the desk I had a Groupon and it was my 2nd class. I wrote my name down and class began. About 2 minutes into the class the owner and the gentlemen I had my orientation class with asked me to talk with them in the office- strange- but I agreed. I followed them in and he proceeded to tell me that I had purchased my Groupon over a year ago. I told him no it was last month not a year ago. He fumbled around, and I explained that I came in mid December, had  a surgery on my arm and so was just starting back. He then told me that my voucher had expired that it is only valid for 30 days from the day it was redeemed. He asked me when I came for my first class I stated on Tuesday, he said he would give me one week until next Tuesday after that I had to pay. The way he spoke to me- a potential gym member, was so unprofessional. He should have waited until after the class had finished, properly introduced himself to me and treated me with respect instead  of rushing me into his office and interrupting my workout.  This is a great example of someone running their business into the ground because they don't know how to build a business. Think I want to join this gym? No way. Ill take my money and time to another gym. Oh and I looked up my Groupon voucher when I got home and it clearly states- I have one year from when the voucher is redeemed to use my 10 classes- not a month!  In short, Good instructors, but an idiot owner/operator who in the end seems more like a ""hustler"" than a leader. Good Luck!",oSBIEFVeAUOSHkFwBIjaHg,stefanie a.,91406

But, this is THE place. I had a personal trainer before and joined 3 different kinds of gyms without really getting anywhere and not feeling encouraged and motivated to keep going. BUT..this is the one and only place that has done that for me. Ditanyon keeps the workouts interesting and changes it up often. Sanam will push you too and I love when she does the kickboxing sessions. Nikki is amazing too...she really kicks your butt (especially those butt workouts..lol..seriously!!) They are super caring and encouraging. They keep you on your toes. They also meet with you to go over your diet and eating habits (hard to break at first, but worth it when you see results) . The classes are a good size and you meet so many great people who are just like you! However, it's not so big that you get lost in the crowd. They really take their time to get to know you (starting with the orientation and assessment and then the weekly/bi-weekly diet meetings).

Finally, there were a few rounds of technical sparring. No one was going crazy or hitting anyone hard. I was a bit worried about this since I hadn't sparred much. In the end, I actually learned some interesting points about how to defend better. We switched up partners between rounds and worked with the main instructor with pads too. There was a lot of attention paid to form and I was given good corrections. The class was free since I was a first timer and even when I insisted I pay, they wouldn't hear of it. I'd surely come back to train here if I come back to LA. PS: What a fantastic city!",4sumaAbzjLblVGG6ac9EJQ,Sanjay J.,91601

All were good BUT Tru Fit is by far the most consistently methodical.  Whether you attend a half hour class or one of the several hour long classes you will find that each class has one or two specific purposes that day (particular muscle group, for example)  and the exercises will be specifically structured with that purpose in mind. The instructors are all good. Even when there are 20 people working out the instructor will be able to spot errors in form or movement and guide you to correct it. The purpose of the exercises are explained in detail and the exercises are demonstrated by the instructor.  There are a wide range of abilities in each class and no one is made to feel uncomfortable if they cannot keep up with certain the pace of certain exercises BUT the instructors WILL encourage to try and give just a little more effort when you think you are ""done"" and you will find the strength to give a little bit more.",2yTbop0cIu6vrvyinPx7YA,Felix K.,91406

Before joining Trufit I was the heaviest I've ever been, stressed out and just stuck in my health and fitness goals. I was a member at Equinox and I loved the classes and the gym overall but it was getting me no where! When my best friend joined Trufit, it was all she could talk about so I had to see what it was all about. Once I started my trial I instantly fell in love with the workouts- very intense but doable. You can start at a 30 min express workout and work your way up from there! The best part is the gym owner Ditanyon. You will never go to another gym and find such a dedicated and hardworking gym owner like D! He knows everyone by name, is so involved in every aspect of the gym and is always working around the clock to do extra events for the members. We have monthly check-ins that help me stay on track towards my goals! Since starting I've lost 13 pounds and 12% body fat! That may not seem like a lot but I've never been this fit in 10 years!

,11567 Santa Monica Blvd,5.0,"Trainers,Gyms,Martial Arts",Timo Knecht Fitness,22,5,Sawtelle,2/11/2018,"First of all, let me start off by saying Timo is amazing! My mom and I started our training with Timo about three years ago. We started exercising with him again a few weeks ago. My mom who has worked with many personal trainers in the past, tells me that Timo is the only person who has the best concentration and the most effective training method for his clients. The same goes for me. We never feel the time pass training with him! His positive energy is reason enough to continue exercising with him. Our routines stay consistent, and at the same time, fresh. In the beginning, we told Timo what we were looking forward to doing in our exercises and what each of our goals were. I wanted to focus more on boxing and kickboxing, and we both wanted to tone our bodies and learn self-defense skills. He is able to pay attention to both of us, since my Mom and I train together. He knows my strengths and weaknesses are different compared to my mom's, so he tweaks our exercises accordingly. Timo challenges us each session and pushes us when he sees we can take it, but never overdoes it. He also encourages us to listen to our bodies and take breaks when we need it.

Okay so I thought I was going to be like some of my friends and all the lucky jerks on TV who bounce right back after baby but come to find out, I was not so lucky. I've always been so scared of working out with a trainer (especially a guy) because I thought I'd get bulky. I like being lean and slim but strong. Timo understands this completely! I haven't looked this fit and felt this strong in so long. He doesn't try to scare you away by making you puke the first session. He's smart and cautious so that he can asses your level accurately before moving forward. Before I knew it I was able to do exercises I've never felt strong enough to do while still actually looking feminine! I selfishly want to keep him a secret before everyone and their mother starts going to him for model work outs but I gotta give him some credit because he changed my body like no other workout ever has!",DcWoO9oZIv-wmwHsi5em8w,Mon O.,90025

Little did I know I'd be making a lifestyle change as opposed to a temporary change. One of the reasons why it is so successful is because it takes a different approach to a traditional gym. I've often felt frustrated working out and never seeing results. At the camp transformation center you are guided by trainers, coordinators, and members that genuinely want you to succeed. You are pushed and challenged to give every workout your all and are constantly reminded to think of your reason 'why'. Instead of dreading a workout, I now look forward to them. I am so grateful to have met some of the most supportive and motivating group of individuals that made waking up every morning for classes worth it. I encourage anyone thinking about it to go for it. If you're willing to work hard, make sacrifices and challenge yourself it is almost impossible not to succeed.",9MOMacFQ-T3gsmiqhP0yDQ,Monique C.,90201

This becomes a lifestyle and not a diet for 6 weeks. I would definitely encourage anyone who wants to make a change in their lives to become part of the Camp.

In 2 years I put on 40 lbs. and I could no longer find motivation to bounce back. I heard of the camp from 2 close friends and I really loved the idea of a fast program that was going to hold me accountable and in essence ""force"" me to lose the weight, it's what I needed. After struggling for years, after joining the camp, I started to see big results week by week, that quickly became by motivation to continue. The workouts and ftdi plan are a full proof way to get where you need to be. Each trainer is very dedicated and the workouts are designed to really push your limits. I give the Bell Camp 4 stars and not 5 because it is a very small location, with the amount of people that attend, most times it's very stuffy and crowded. Also, I feel there should be more classes available. 9pm classes and later classes on the weekend I think would greatly benefit those who work full time and weekends.

I started out the camp after seeing a friend's AMAZING transformation, and thought what do I have to loose? I have spent hundred and possible thousands on gyms, trainers, waist trainers, juice cleanse, diets, pills, detox teas, you name it! So I went to the seminar and on the spot decided to going. I'm a go big or go home type of gal! I can honestly say it has been the best decision I've made so far and I am grateful to everyone here at camp bell! The people are amazing it really is a great atmosphere. Everyone is super motivating, I mean I can't even tell you how many times I felt like giving up and someone in the class would always be there to push me and say you can do it! The trainers are also phenomenal every last one of them! The brothers from hell (you'll get to know them) are extra killer, you will feel like a million dollars after you are done. All classes are an hour long but you honestly won't even feel the time pass by. All the classes are different and fun and you will eventually meet a nice friend named SALLY who you will learn to have a love hate relationship with. I can go on and on about my great experience here but I won't write an entire book. Bottom line if you really want to make a healthy change and you are ready to leave all the excuses behind join the camp! This place will teach you just what amazing changes your body can make in 6 short weeks! The entire program is designed for you to succeed. So YOU can achieve YOUR goals by working hard, following the rules and taking it upon yourself to make a few small changes to your everyday life, they will give you everything you need but it's up to you to follow through! With all of this being said I encourage everyone to give it a try! And to the entire Staff at Camp Bell Thank you all for this amazing experience!",YlBXLhdwxqmYWCsWAQ2dFg,Daisy R.,90201

I looked at there page, saw a video, and instantly knew I had to try it. I attended an orientation and this is where it all started. On November 9th, 2015 I weighed in at 208.9 lb. For six weeks after that I went to work out at 5 am because that was the most convenient time for me. I also learned a healthy way of eating which I have yet to master. Every Monday I would weigh in and see a negative change to my favor on the scale. I must admit by week five of the challenge I was very nervous, I had already lost 14.5 lb and had 5.5 lb to go by the following Monday to reach my goal of 20 lb in 6 weeks. To my surprise on Monday December 21, 2015 at 6:15 am I was at 188.7 lb. I reached my goal and passed it by 2 oz. The staff was totally AMAZING! I greatly appreciate them for being there for me every morning, to push me and make me believe that I could do it and most importantly have me do it. The time they put in and dedication they show is like no other. I have done so many weigh loss programs but nothing as worked for me like this. This is not a pill or a quick fix, it is a total life style change that I plan to continue. I thought 20 lb in 6 weeks was too much and maybe not a realistic number but I was proven otherwise. This was my first challenge but not my last, I look forward to the up coming challenge this new years to continue my weigh loss journey and live a happy and healthy life. #STAYFITDONTQUIT",bK6CalncexFv1t6YZ2l-LA,Jeny A.,90201

We moved to DTLA after our home on the Westside of nearly 40 years burned down and I was consumed with stress and all of the logistics related to that. Luckily, Pure Barre DTLA was a block away from our temporary housing and I got the courage to go in. Although I considered myself to be in reasonable shape for a 65 year old and was pretty regular on the elliptical and taking very long walks, it had been years since I had taken any kind of a class (think back to the '80's when some of us did aerobics and Jane Fonda...). Pure Barre appealed to me because it is high intensity but low impact and I always loved ballet even though the only thing I really mastered was the plie -  Anyway, it has now been 2 months of going almost every day and I can't tell you how welcoming and supportive all of the instructors have been as I try to learn the exercises. The first week or so was hard - so hard I had trouble rolling out of bed because my muscles hurt so much - but bit by bit the new strength pushes off the soreness and each day's class is now the one time that is totally about taking care of myself and thinking about nothing other than what I am instructed to do as I get stronger and stronger. Although each instructor I have had is great, I like that each has a slightly different style and seems to find new muscles or a new position each time I go. I like too that everyone is working toward their own personal best and the instructors help with that no matter whether you are a first timer or a regular.

I specifically love the downtown LA studio because 1) it's close to my work 2) everyone that works there is super helpful and welcoming 3) Katelin, the owner, is super involved in the studio..which makes all the difference because you can tell she cares and wants to make it a personalized experience for everyone. All of the instructors are awesome, so you always feel like you got a good workout in. They have really cute retail. The studio setup is nice and inviting, and they have two bathrooms.

The place is really clean and nicely designed, teachers are super nice (Thanks, Katelin and DeAnne who I went to most of my classes because of my schedule are awesome.) Most importantly, pure barre really helps! I feel so much stronger on my arms and abs after went there 10 times. I had lower back pain because of my job of sitting too long. But the work out helps me to strengthen my abs and back. I feel very energetic after the class. If possible, going to the class every day makes a lot difference to me than every other day or 3 times a week. Also, the class is not like my other gym classes-jump up and down finally get tired. The small movements that they teach really pinpoint the essence of the work out. And of course, Pure Barre is a great addition to DTLA!",aMwdXOaWXme18k93xUd4PQ,Ye H.,90014

Every class I've been to is pretty packed but there is always space and its never too overcrowded. The teachers are amazing! All of them have been so great and I've been happy to try the morning, afternoon and night classes so I've got to try them all out. They are always encouraging, high energy and upbeat!

The studio is clean, the instructors show tough love (encourages and challenges you at the same time), and the friendly staff strive to remember your name and make your visit as pleasant as possible. While body transformation can't be guaranteed, I personally got stronger (physically and mentally), leaner, and above all, more excited to work out on a consistent basis.

I took 3 classes at this studio. The carpet floor is somewhat unhygienic to me. Couple classes were ok. Nothing is special compared to other barre classes. The worst experience I had was when I took my class with this one instructor. I always use the mat for pushup because my hand and wrist are sensitive. She took my mat away and said I don't need it. I told her that my hand is sensitive.  It is my personal medical condition. She was literally rolling her eyes and asked my sister, who I referred to take a class at this studio: ""Do you have hand sensitive too?"". We just couldn't believe it.  The class was fast paced and the instructor didn't take time to correct everyone's forms. My sister is a newbie to Barre and she was struggling with her forms. The instructor only corrected her form once. Overall, I'm still in shock of an instructor judging how I need to use extra support for my hand and wrist. I don't think I'll come back to the studio, just because of that experience.  I feel that as someone with medical condition & the fitness instructor cannot be emphathy for that. It's pathetic.",gUdeWzhIzYbs4D2Vih9kEg,Kat Y.,90014

I really have grown to love Pure Barre. The classes are fun and challenging. I can tell that I am getting stronger given that the moves are getting easier and I can hold a lot of the exercises longer. I have taken numerous classes at the downtown LA location and I love all of the instructors.

My first class was TOUGH. It's a workout that gets a lot of little muscles that I can't really get to usually. Each exercise completely targets one muscle group and will completely burn it out by the end of the class. Even as I'm getting stronger and more used to the exercises in the class, the class is just as challenging the more I'm able to engage in it.

I lost about 15 lbs and 5.5% body fat by FTDI! Very happy about that! It was hard and took lots of prep and sacrifice but it worked! I beat the challenge (thankfully) but the problem I had was with the Bell location itself. I feel they didn't give me all the information I needed to make a sound decision before signing with them. When I told them I didn't live in Bell and couldn't make the trip everyday, they just said ""no problem. We have locations all over! Even TJ!"" I live in Long Beach so most of my 30 workouts were at the LB location. They NEVER told me my official weigh ins could only be done at Bell, though.... very inconvenient. I also had a hard time getting a hold of them because MANY times they just wouldn't answer the phone. I would have to call LB because they always answered and were very helpful. Problem was that sometimes they didn't want to give me certain advise because they didn't want to say something different than what Bell wanted me to do. Understandable but because of this I didn't really feel I had the support I was promised by Bell. A lot of times I just had to use my best judgement. And since this was my first challenge, it was very nerve-wrecking. It made me feel discouraged. They also charged my credit card incorrectly, and there were a few other things that just made me lose faith in them.

The first week of the camp was tough, but within that week I noticed something I hadn't been able to do on my own. I was completely off of my blood pressure medicine. I was in complete shock and disbelief as to how quick the camp helped me achieve this milestone in life. At this point I was already sold on the product the camp was selling and regardless if I passed my challenge or not my expectations were beyond exceeded. Now all this happened in only one week so imagine what else could happen in the next 5. I lost the weight I was supposed and more. I'm happy to say that within 6 weeks I was able to lose 24.9 pounds.

I do gotta say though that, although I signed up at Bell, I ended up doing 27 of my 30 Check ins at the East LA Camp. That camp is much bigger with a lot more parking and the trainers are also my favorite. One I didn't really like is that weigh ins have to be done in Downey because they don't have the special machine at Bell and they don't partner up with East LA, which is an inconvenience.

I had a baby 1 year ago and fell into a rut I couldn't get motivated to work out all I wanted was to lay in bed with the baby. One day I finally decided to call and I'm so happy with my decision. I signed up for the 5% body fat in 6 weeks thinking I would fail but still being motivated by the money back guarantee. I attended the nutritional seminar and thought again I can't eat this way I'm not gonna make it, yet still I choose to continue. My first day was the worse eating was a burden it was too much food, the work-outs were great until I threw up. That's when I approached Josh one of the trainers and his response was go at ur own pace but it was the right advice. He gave me peace of mind and confidence with those few words. I powered through the first week and met different trainers and they all had the same encouraging attitude. I could tell that they enjoy helping others not once did I encounter a negative attitude from anyone at the camp. Towards the end of my challenge Christian knew me by name and pushed me to work out harder and lift heavier. I won't lie it was a little frustrating at times but it helps in the long run. I now completed my challenge I lost 5.9% body fat and lost 10lbs. I would recommend this camp to anyone even if you think u can't like I did at the start just takes a little bit of actual effort.

I joined the camp because I wanted to stop putting up excuses as to not being able to go out with my friends whenever they'd invite me to go out.

My fiancé and I are doing our very first 6 week challenge with The Camp to lose 20 lbs. They give you an eating plan, and supplemental products to get you started, all you gotta do is follow it accordingly or FTDI, which is follow the damn instructions as they say.

I was heavy for my size, wasn't eating right, didn't know how to properly workout, etc.. Nonetheless, I was definitely going to take a bit of work. I called (she answered promptly) as you will  soon see that she always does, and invited me into her home. We discussed plans, I walked out feeling good but unsure if all of our goals would REALLY be met (I'd never had a ""personal trainer""). My goal was to lose around 15 pounds and to pass a Physical Fitness Qualifier that was very demanding for my age (21). It is now November, I lost 25+ pounds and know my way pretty well around a gym. She gave me a strict nutrition guide to follow and stayed on top of me the whole way through. Throughout the past 7 months she was more than accommodating, always working around my busy/changing schedule and never once missed a message or a phone call. On top of this, she KILLED our workouts. We worked muscles out that I never even knew existed. Guys, she is a total pro. She's humble, beautiful inside and out, and just an overall outstanding person. She never makes you feel awkward and she does the workouts with you, like who else does that? When I was working out with her, many other trainers weren't giving their 100% to their clients. Many were on their phones and not engaging. She's not like this, not even the slightest bit negligent. Coach Maggie won't let you go home until you get it done and you get it done right, what you pay is well worth it for the healthy lifestyle you will adapt afterwards. She's phenomenal, I couldn't recommend anybody better to start your fitness regime with. She's a badass. I now weigh in, passed my test, and got my dream job because of her guidance. You truly gain a friend after working with her as well, if you have doubts about trainers or are skimming through these reviews for the one that best suites you you can stop here cause she's the best.

I'm a 46 years old Pediatric RN & I have to say, I can't believe how much my body & confidence has changed, for the better! I have friends complimenting me at work & want to know how I did it:) Well, I definitely couldn't have done it without Maggie's love, guidance, support & kick butt workouts! She has not only taught me to workout free of injury (watches you for proper form) but also taught me to be smart about proper nutrition which is essential to not only looking good, but most importantly, feeling good! Maggie is very knowledgeable, personable, compassionate and funny as heck! She makes working out FUN & SO WORTH IT! It's no wonder my teenage daughters, ages 19, 17 & 14, enjoy their workouts & look forward to the next one. Maggie is the first and last trainer I'll ever have, because there is no other like her.

I found LaShawn on Yelp and my only regret is not finding him sooner! He is not only an amazing trainer who will help you to achieve your fitness goals, but he is also there to help you with the nutrition side of things (which is just as important). He is readily available with helpful food tips and workouts on-demand and he goes above and beyond for his clients. LaShawn has not only helped me lose weight, but he has taught me the correct way to workout in addition to making better decisions when it comes to my diet. Prior to meeting LaShawn, I never got excited about going to the gym, but now I look forward to each and every session as he pushes me to perform at a  level of intensity that I wouldn't be able to achieve without him. I could go on for pages and pages about why training with LaShawn will be the best decision you will ever make, but you should stop what you're doing and schedule a session with him now!",dwofn4bNdCSNmCT1MyNAAg,Serena S.,90401

They make sure to know your name and pay close attention to your form throughout the class.  They emphasize form and say it is the most important part of the workout to help maximize results, and it's true.  Even though I come to the class frequently, they still correct me every day which pushes me to work harder.  Someone else had mentioned that it feels like it's a private class sometimes since the instructors are so hands-on, which I completely agree with it.  The instructors are also very approachable and friendly, and I really look forward to my workout now.

The Bar Method is a really fun and challenging class that never really gets easy...easier...but not easy! The studio is very nice and the instructors are friendly and motivating. I had to leave because I moved out of the area and I will say, the one negative experience I had here was trying to discontinue my ""club bar"" membership. I was required to pay for an extra month even though I gave notice before my monthly renewal date and had completed the required minimum contract time...a little disappointing because it's a service, not an apartment lease, I don't think requiring 30 days when I need to quit for good cause is warranted.

I've also taken a class at PureBarre on Sunset, and man oh man, The Bar Method is FAR SUPERIOR! The instructor at PureBarre (at least the one on Sunset) did NOTHING about ANYONE's posture. Proper form is KEY to these bar classes, and every single instructor I've had at The Bar Method really pay attention to your form.

I started training at Show Up with Adriano about 8 months ago and I'm soo happy I found this place! Adriano is the best of the best! The gym has everything you need and they keep it meticulously clean. All of the trainers are so friendly and I have never once felt intimidated--all levels of fitness are welcome here.  I could barely do 1 push up when I first started training with Adriano and I'm now doing push ups, chin ups, and hip thrusting more than double my body weight. I recommend him to my family, friends and anyone who asks, whether they're a beginner or someone experienced who feels like they've hit a plateau in their journey. He has been so supportive and listens to all of my concerns, goals, and questions. I wanted to slim down before my wedding and with his help I lost inches off my body. And the best part is he makes it fun! I love showing up! He incorporates new exercises, ensures I maintain proper form, and is always motivating me to reach for more.  A++++++ trainer with the most positive energy!

I had been working out on punching bags in a serious kickboxing gym. But, after years of that training, I ended up with a long-term wrist injury. Since my girlfriend had always raved about Show Up and about being trained by Tom, I decided to give it a try. And, low and behold, Tom knows the body like no-one else. While my injury (being treated still) is one that will take time to heal, Tom knows exactly how to give me the best workouts while ensuring that we don't affect my injury one bit. Now, I'm getting in amazing shape while learning how to have proper technique and to prevent injuries. Learning proper technique is, to me, one of the best reasons to have a great trainer. I've learned so much that will keep me safe, not injured, and in shape for the long run. If you prefer a regular gym, at least have a great trainer teach you HOW to work out properly before you make mistakes on your own that will cost you your health later. Oh, all the people at this gym are friendly and welcoming.",sZ_QPl7A4B5n09kGd7SwQw,Enrique O.,90403

The results are amazing and watching yourself get stronger is insane. Who knew that dead lifting, squatting and hip thrusting was fun?

The gym is great and everyone is helpful and non judgmental so you never feel embarrassed.

We went to work right away on adjusting my workout regimen with some stretching and foam rolling to heal up the shoulder. He also sat me down and talked about my diet, saying that what I was eating could be causing extra inflammation and slowing down the healing process of the shoulder... 4 months later, IM STRONGER, HEALTHIER,  AND FUNCTIONING WITHOUT PAIN.

Are you ready?",1207 4th St,5.0,"Trainers,Nutritionists",Show Up Fitness,95,5,,3/2/2017,"I've truly enjoyed my time at Show Up Fitness - great facility, solid equipment, and not overbooked for private training. But what's really helped lead me to some of my strongest fitness and lifestyle gains over the last few months is working out with Adriano. From the initial goal setting/evaluation he really seemed to understand what I was looking to accomplish in terms of weight loss and all around fitness. He's tailored our ongoing workout plan around these goals and checks in on my cardio and diet for accountability and encouragement. Far from the 1 size fits all training mentality I've run into elsewhere before. Definitely enjoying the workouts, encouragement, and results at Show Up.",IyeU-CzCBhG2QBz36uFSKg,Owen S.,90403
