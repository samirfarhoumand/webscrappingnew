I love the motivation you get from the workout as a group. The energy you get from the minute you walk in the door is contagious. Everyone is very nice and helpful. I loved the warm welcome from the front des guys. The locker rooms are incredibly clean---there are USB charging ports in each locker to charge your phone during class which is great after a day of work or being all over the city that day. The workout is fantastic! If you love HIIT you'll love this class. I really like how strength training is in the mix. You can start off on the treadmills or start off with the weights, your choice. Drake was the trainer and he was great. He kept the energy going the entire 60 minutes and was very kind and personable. If he saw someone doing an exercise wrong he would let you know so that you start to do it correctly. Don't listen to the bs people tell you about how it's clickish and you won't fit in because that's a lie---just do the same thing other people are doing or clearly you are not being a part of the actual class that you're taking.

Winner of LA Magazine, Best of Los Angeles 2011 for our Student Instructor Pilates.",5700 W Pico Blvd,5.0,"Pilates,Trainers",Whole Body Method,108,5,Mid-City,3/13/2013,"After having done Pilates about a year and loving the lengthening and strengthening that you just don't get with the conventional gym equipments, I wanted to deepen my learning and understanding of the Pilates methodology. Having researched several different Pilates certification programs, I committed myself to Whole Body Method because of (a) the classical training that they offered, (b) the nurturing, intimate environment with the very knowledgeable/experienced owner Nigel who is very much engaged in the studio and the instruction of his students, (c) the well-balanced and well-paced training program. And I was especially drawn to their student client-teaching program that the studio is well-reputed for.  Personally believing that teaching is a different skill set than merely learning the exercises for yourself,  I found the opportunity to interact and practice w/ real clients to be the highlight of the program. It helped me to understand Pilates not only for my body, but for other bodies, which in the end had really fostered my growth as a Pilates instructor. While many programs out there have this component, not many actually set the students up w/ clients but rather are left on their own. ",qt5mKen3Y347Y48oxgbBkw,LH A.,90019

I've never cycled before but Now I can't get enough. Never before have I gotten a physical and emotional breakthrough at the same time. First it starts with 10 minutes of core where you feel like ok I've got this, and by the time the ten minutes is up you really feel your abs come to life.  Then 20 minutes of weight training followed up with 30 minutes on the bike. Halfway through the cycling, I reached a point where I noticed my physical limits were not the only thing being pushed, life changes came into perspective, things I wanted to pursue, things I needed to stop, habits to break, new goals to make, all culminating with pushing my body; to CHOOSE to do one more hill. There's a point in the class where you make a choice to push through all of it, the limits you set on yourself both physically and mentally. It's amazing.

Narina and Elaine, the two who run AAY, are amazing, and the way they have designed the program is really great.  Every week the program changes, so it diversifies the workouts and keeps it interesting.  Narina and Elaine also incorporate sports once in a while - basketball, soccer, football - which is a great way to do a lot of cardio and have fun at the same time. The workouts they create are difficult enough to be challenging for me, but not so torturous that I never want to go back. The workouts always include running, and depending on the purpose of each day, we use weights, medicine balls, tubing, resistance bands, and jump ropes. I love Nar and Elaine's approach because their energy is always very positive, and they are completely supportive.  They push everyone to try hard, but it's never overwhelming.  One of the greatest things about the AAY program is that it encompasses a variety of goals, so that weight loss is one of several goals, and not the sole purpose.  Narina and Elaine also focus heavily on being healthy by eating well and taking care of your body. In AAY, nutrition and exercise go hand in hand to ensure a healthier lifestyle. I really appreciate this because I joined AAY to lose weight, but also to get stronger and be healthier.  I like that it isn't all about how many pounds I've dropped.  Every 4 weeks or so, I get weighed and measured, and then I get an email that shows me how much weight, inches, and body fat I've lost, and how much muscle I've gained.  It's really helpful to see my progress on a chart.  Also, I always record my food, and Narina and Elaine check it weekly, make comments, and give feedback. Making small changes in what I eat and when I eat, has definitely helped me. I joined AAY six months ago, and I've definitely seen changes in my body, which motivates me to continue with bootcamp. Basically, I love the workouts, the people are great, and the program works. Narina and Elaine are the greatest trainers anyone can have!",vpJM-vX0B3RpTgSxFEvakA,Larisa M.,90065

Elaine and Narina are so encouraging, warm but they also push you and check up on you. Most importantly, it was hard for me to believe..but its not just about the money. Elaine, actually changed my membership for me TWICE so that I got the most out of my money. I had bought a ten pack she switched it (without me asking) to a one month thinking I would get more out of my money and when I hadn't used 10 in a month, without me asking she switched it back to 10 sessions so that I would get the most out of my money. I never even asked...this place is about getting you to work out and working with you. Also, Erica, one of the instructors is awesome.

In fact, they have inspired me so much, I am working toward becoming a certified trainer, as well! Elaine and Narina create such a supportive, positive and challenging environment in class. They really kick your butt while tailoring the workout to you. They get to know what you can do and what your limits are; when to push you because you're just being lazy and when to modify the exercise because you have a bad back. It's like having a personal trainer minus the cost of one. :) They're also committed to helping you with nutrition - offering tours of Trader Joes, food journals and nutritional counseling. The workouts vary each week and can include kickboxing, running, soccer, basketball, football, obstacle courses, dumbbells, tubing, etc. . . and you don't even have to be good at these sports to get a great workout!

I believe the class was supposed to have five people-which is very small and intimate!

I can't get enough -- wish I could be there every day. Jill is an excellent teacher, especially for beginners and for more advanced students who want to build their skills safely and healthily. Her classes are small and she exercises an abundance of caution, which is so important with aerial -- but I still feel like I've progressed at the right pace and am learning something new every week. She has great attention to detail and gives us exercises to improve our form and fluidity. I've been to several other studios in LA and, while I enjoy trying new places (and they are much closer in distance), there is a reason that Aerial Physique is my 'primary' studio and the place I keep buying class packages again and again. Jill is also a GORGEOUS aerialist and very inspiring to watch. The other teachers are fabulous as well.

I was an absolute beginner with no experience in dance or gymnastics when I came to Jill's intro class over a year ago. I'm not sure I would have stuck with silks had I gone to a different studio. Jill was so friendly and welcoming and made sure that even a beginner like me could accomplish some fun things my very first class. I always felt safe and that Jill was giving each student individual attention. She is just the BEST instructor. If you are thinking about trying silks but are scared because you have no idea what you're doing...GO TO JILL. She will make it fun, safe and leave you wanting to learn more. Terribly sad I don't live in LA anymore and can't keep taking classes from Jill. Whenever I visit, you can bet I will be trying to get into one of her classes.

This place is an Asian la fitness. It is spacey so no worries about it being a small gym. The gym has two floors but the stairs are steep. They do provide workout clothes but you have to ask for it. They're pretty bad at giving it to you up front. I guess they assume people like working out in their own clothes. The gym upstairs has a cafe too but they don't have any weights upstairs. Not even small Dumbbells. No Bueno. The available soap/shampoo in the showers are horrible quality. I recommend bringing your own. For the price you pay, I don't think that it's worth it. I suggest Equinox.",RkMUmwv45kDOEpPyEYiMWQ,Dory N.,90010

Here the thing. My friend and I went to wilfit early in the morning today we had a plan to try the gym for a day and then if we like it we going to sign the day after for the $90 month to month. So I spoke with the guy in the reception him can we try it today and we going to sign up Tomorrow. He told me that you can't and if you want a day pass is $12 I tell him no problem but if we came back tomorrow are you going to subtract the $12 from the $90? He told me no. I told him no problem I don't want a day pass can I sign up for the month to month and we going to pay $90 each today. He told me sorry no because the manager isn't here today!!! you can come in the weekdays. To sign. I told him okay goodbye lmao. However I went to fitness M which is just few blocks away. A sweet girl was in the reception I told her the same thing that I told the guy works in wilfit and she told me of course you can and she gave us 3 day pass for free with a key for the locker room and dresses. !

They provide clean towels, gym clothes, and state of art gym equipment. Restrooms and shower rooms are absolutely immaculate. The gym is very spacious for Koreatown. Can I just say, I love that the weights are all in the proper racks (I never experienced this at LA fitness...)  Classes are included with membership (except for line dancing). The yoga and Pilates instructors were both enthusiastic and made classes go by in no time at all! Caution- if you do go for the group/student membership, they charge a $150-$180 fee ON TOP OF the monthly payments due for the rest of the year. In other words, you must be 100% committed if you want to take advantage of the discounts. I believe the standard month to month membership is around $75.

I have never been a huge fan of gyms or classes. Gyms and gym equipment tend to scare me. Orange Theory has been a perfect fit because the trainers and staff are incredibly welcoming, supportive, knowledgeable and fun! The trainers also correct form when necessary, which is very helpful for people like me who have never done many of the exercises. I genuinely enjoy going to class because of the amazing trainers and support staff, not to mention friendly clientele. The energy at OTF Brentwood is incredibly positive all the way around. I highly recommend at least giving it a try. I have already noticed a significant increase in strength and energy levels and reduction in stress. The class schedule is also very beneficial to anyone with a tight work schedule - there are many options available. I would give it more than five stars if possible because it is a miracle that I show up three times a week!",yn3ikIHjzfLqVSw3_elxbw,K S.,90049

I'm not a professional athlete, I never was. I'm just a regular guy, just like you that grew up with weight issues that have stuck with me all my life. Always picked last for sports, never wanted to take my shirt off at the beach. I've tried every diet, I've tried every gym. Nothing seemed to work. I gain, I lose, and I gain it back again. About a year ago I was more than ready to make a permanent change in my life. 30 was around the corner and I was tired of being embarrassed and not feeling comfortable with who I was. Around that time I got word that OrangeTheory was moving into the Brentwood neighborhood. I gave it a try and haven't looked back since. The workouts were challenging; they gave me the perfect balance between cardio and weight training that I felt was lacking from other gym workouts. There was that feeling of community from the second I walked through the door. The staff was friendly, welcoming, and made me feel like I belonged. OTF isn't just a gym to me, its become a part of my lifestyle. I'm there every day pushing myself 100% just like the first day I joined. I'm now 30 and in the best shape of my life. I'm competing at a level with professional athletes. Without the constant support and motivation of the trainers I would never have known I could push myself to achieve everything I have. Huge shout out to Jonathan, Lal, JZ, Brendon, Paul, Delvon, Whitney, Bruce, and all the staff. You have changed my life for the better and I will always be humbled by your love and support. - BG",o8T0bbUqu4sORj-WafWkOg,Brent G.,90049

The heart monitor is a great concept that really has you focused on your individual workout, you compete with yourself and not those around you, the monitor shows your heart rate by color so easy to follow and increase or decrease the intensity of your workout on a real time basis. It also shows the calories you are burning as you progress thru the workout I find myself setting a calorie burning goal during each session which pushes me even when I don't feel like working out that day and we all have those days.

I was scared to let go, why, i am not exactly sure. Now, I am pleased to report that I am actually running (or what I like to call power jogging) and am really proud of this accomplishment. I think that's the thing with OTF- you actually see changes physically and mentally as you believe you can do something because you are actually doing it.  I have been going 3x a week and have seen my inches change, the scale change and my overall attitude change. Thanks for the encouragement Delvon, Bruce, Dana and Lal. The coaches really coach you. They are not mere talking heads, but motivators (sometimes masters of torture, but I mean that in the best possible way). I also have to give a major shout out to the front desk/management team- Adam, Damian, Vanessa, Ashley and some names I am forgetting (sorry guys).

The music is great, the staff and trainers are extremely friendly and always willing to help (yet not overly attentive), and the workout is unlike any other. It's truly addicting. Plus, the fact that you can actually watch your heart rate, progress, and calories burning while working out is an added plus and point of motivation. Then at the end as you stretch, the instructors go over the heart rate stats with you and explain what it all really means and how to improve in the future. All in all, I am so happy my friend dragged me to O.T. one day and got me hooked. It's changed my body and my whole perspective on working out. I used to primarily do cardio and yoga and not really think I needed to do weight training since I wasn't trying to bulk up. However, adding that muscle mass hasn't made me bulk up at all, it's just made me feel stronger, healthier, more toned and lean, and better about my body overall and its performance both in OT and in my other weekly workout routines. So thanks for everything, OT!  don't plan on quitting any time soon!",tU2zxnbQgPbJJoWlIsNAlw,Lindsey S.,90049

JZ is the best! I have always been an athlete but after college I slowly lost interest in staying in shape. Years went by and I started noticing the effects. Even though I kept trying to remotivate myself using he same workouts I used to do, I was never seeing results. I had gotten bored of running and didn't know how to change my eating habits in a way that would stick since I already ate pretty healthily. JZ's nutritional coaching taught me what I was doing wrong and how I could be better. She also figured out why my workouts were causing the pains they were and tapped into what motivates me. At Orange theory I felt safe to be pushed harder than I would have on my own bc the trainers are watching your heart rate and know when to make you push yourself more than you thought you could, and how to properly use the equipment so that you are actually getting the full burn. 2 thumbs up!!",8oA7usRyZTWmjcJPq201rw,Michelle H.,90049

The workout is a combination of treadmills, rowing machines and floor work with body weight exercises and weights. The 1 hour class moves quickly and the heart rate monitor (provided) gives you continuous feedback to let you know how hard you are working (and if you're competitive, because everyone's stats are on large TV monitors you see how you are doing vs. others in the class!) The instructor I had was top quality, and seemed to really care about my result. Another positive is that each person can work at their own pace.  Young or not so young, you will always be able to ""keep up"" with the class.  I think the first visit is free, so for anyone looking to maximize their results I suggest giving Orange Theory a try!  One note: You need to bring your own towel or buy one.",B6HJTWWCxWzPZBVhuI392Q,Russell E.,90049

In fact, my workout is my favorite part of my day and I look forward to coming here after work to every single day. I have been to a few other studios and they don't even compare to how amazing the Brentwood location is. I take most classes with either Delvon or Bruce and they're both great. They push you and the music is on point. Also, the staff at the front desk are always SO pleasant to work with on scheduling classes, questions, or concerns. I also love the family atmosphere here.

The treadmill/rowing machine/floor circuit style is like the perfect group class for people who usually prefer to work out independently. Due to the smaller size of the class and the types of machines you always kind of have your own little zone. As someone who's worked with personal trainers a lot in the past, I find this to be a similar feel and thus a tremendous value. Having your heart rate percentage and calorie burn constantly up on the screen is a great motivator and makes it fun like a game where you know your score. I've already recommended OT to all of my friends...Also the trainers are all really cool, super fit, and they are very positive and push you too. I've taken Ashley, JZ, Bruce, and Ken's classes so far and across the board I'm really impressed with their ability to deliver an consistent yet individualized experience.

But not only that- the facility is top-notch, the instructors are helpful and friendly, and the work out method is great. I also heard that there will be a West LA facility opening in a few months- so I'm excited to try that one out (closer to home). They have various studios, so you're sure to find one that's convenient for you. They really appeal to all levels of fitness/age/ability. I've done other fitness classes where they give you one variation of an exercise- so you're kinda left to your own devices or you sit it out. Not here- the instructors are extremely knowledgable, so off the bat they will give you at least 2 variations. In today's class, he gave me 4 ways of doing an exercise. Having a knee injury, I appreciate that kind of consideration. But also- if you want an intense workout and don't want to be slowed down- you get that experience. And if you need some accommodation- they provide that too. It's like a group class with individual instruction. So you never feel like you're slowing others down. The music keeps you moving and you realize you're pushing yourself beyond your limits. Also, seeing your heart rate being monitored and being motivated to push a little more makes you feel very accomplished and satisfied. And yes, it is a bit expensive- but you can spend hundreds of dollars on advertised health products or here on classes to feel good. Sometimes, these gyms can feel cultish- but they make a great effort to include everyone and not make you feel left out because you're not 100% paleo. You now have to buy the heart monitor, but they said you can use it at all of the facilities and on the plus side- you don't worry about sharing sweaty straps.

This studio does something completely different from any other gym i've been to. They use science with the workout. They Incorporate heart rate monitors and hook them up to TV screens.... brilliant!  I feel one of the biggest reasons why a lot of people have problems losing weight and transforming their bodies is because they don't understand the science behind HOW to lose weight. So many people run on the treadmill for what seems like hours and see no changes in their body. They plateau and can't get over that hump. The light bulb officially went off when the coach was telling us in detail us about the different zones and the amount of time that needs to be spent in each level. ,1tUcnj2Ovepzj4eCZ-Bypw,Ariel J.,90049

They are so consistent in pushing their members to be better every time they come in, they're super friendly, and as someone with complete OCD, the gym and bathrooms & showers are spotless.

It allows you to monitor and adjust your effort level with a degree of accuracy I hadn't been able to attain by ""listening to my body.""

Most of the people who go to this gym are working professionals, so selfies are definitely kept to the absolute minimum. At the time we were members, the gym was never overly crowded, the amenities were excellent, the staff was professional, and the equipment was clean.  I'd have to give it to the management for providing a very well run facility. The salespeople were not pushy at all, and simply gave their prices without annoying sales tactics.  The only reason why we are no longer members is because we moved away from the area.  100% recommended.

The past two and a half months of working with one of their Pilates coaches twice a week has made an enormous impact on my strength and endurance. I've regained mobility and flexibility that I haven't had in years, and the price for the early-bird membership and private coaching is less than joining a Pilates studio alone.

They take the time to get to know you as a person, and are invested in your growth and happiness in and outside of class.  There's something for everyone; as a beginner, you get to learn in a safe, positive environment. For the more advanced students, you can try out a greater range of tricks with the high ceiling, and Jill and her team always have a clever twist on seemingly standard moves.  They do a great job of building options into their moves, so you can work up to the full versions, or really push yourself if you're strong enough to do an extra beastly version.  They are better known for their silks, but I also highly recommend Kiki's hoop class. She is so positive, and so supportive as a teacher, and blends conditioning and fun perfectly in her classes.  I love this studio, and I can't wait to see how they'll grow!",eqaRa0izpd-4UvDvWWaHzg,Laura R.,90016

The members are kind, welcoming, and friendly.  I cannot comment on the cost because I have nothing to compare it to.  I do know that my health and well-being are worth it and I can easily drop the same amount of cash on eating out and frivolous items.  The workouts are varied and include using dumbbells/bands/and jump ropes, kickboxing,  running/jogging/power walking, steps, and your own body weight.  This is not a your typical ""boot camp.""  They will never yell at you or make you feel bad, but instead push and motivate you in a positive way to help you meet your goals.  ",JfXlNivlkF88ToxCVbSZlw,Robert P.,90065

I have been hooked ever since. At first, I only attended 2-3 days a week and went to spinning the other days. Now I go 5 days a week at 5:45 AM. It's early but it has been worth it and I love it.

I came here to become more athletic to improve in the sport I play. For a long time I've been doing the training all on my own and just kind of doing trial and error. The results of doing it on my own have led to minor injuries, bodily imbalances, and minor improvements. I came to Fast Lean Fit to not only improve but to LEARN how to properly get better. There I met Dan the owner who gave me a great consultation and really set the tone for the Fast Lean Fit brand. He then got me training for 4 sessions with Sabrina. I had a blast training with Sabrina. I've had other personal training sessions before but I don't think I've ever improved as much as I have with Sabrina. Most of my trial and error was comprised of strength training and explosive movements and not much else. Sabrina got me to work on balance (which I really didn't know was that bad till we started), agility, explosiveness, and strength. I've seen such improvements in my game. Most importantly, I think this training gave me more confidence in my game. With all the bad things I was doing to myself, I was more prone to flinching in game and being too scared to injure myself. Now that I'm physically a little more capable and less prone to injury due to the improvements, I'm less likely to be afraid and go for bigger plays. I'm so happy with all that I've gained from training here. Sabrina was very patient but also never let me have it easy. She is also a wealth of information and a former professional jouster. Any questions I had she was able to answer. I'm sure every personal trainer at Fast Lean Fit is amazing but if you get a chance, I say train with Sabrina. I unfortunately have to temporarily stop personal training at FLF because of personal career and housing changes. However, I definitely plan on coming back and getting to the next level. Sabrina has given me the tools to keep training on my own till we see each other again and I personally cannot wait. If you feel like you have hit a wall in your training please try FLF.

I generally was against personal trainers and wanted to find a gym but thought I would give it a try since I was moving back to L.A. after 12 years in NYC. It seemed like all my friends who live in L.A. got results from a trainer than a gym membership. After doing a consultation, I told myself to try it out for a month and see how I feel, not just assessing if this is for me through results, but if I feel comfortable and if personal training was for me. And let's be honest, you really don't ""see"" results for a good 3-5 months... well at least for me. Well, needless to say, I really enjoyed the one on one attention, the coaching, accountability, and the expertise Danny brought. He not only made the workout worthwhile but I also learned a lot about form, the right way to do exercises, and the technicalities behind the routines. After a few months, I told myself that I will stick with it and at a certain point I will probably retain what I learned and fly by myself. Not the case... there is a different dynamic with Danny (and the other trainers here). After some reflection and thinking about the benefits of working with him, it has become more than a workout. It has become a routine in my weekly schedule and I have come to find a sense of community. The other trainings (including Johnny, Sky, and Oscar) are really cool and in some way, it keeps me accountable. They will notice if they don't see you for a while (sometimes you want to go to a happy hour, right?) and I always look forward to heading to the gym. They also have member events now and again such as rock climbing and other activities to enhance your connectivity to the program and gym, which is a bonus. ",T_6Iu0cC3xj1QUsfR6HGvQ,D.K. C.,90020

Plus, the best thing about this gym is that there are the best trainers in the town. Danny, Johnny, Tae are the best trainers I have ever experienced in my life.

No warm up. Straight into abs, followed by a fast-paced, aerobic weight routine using heavy weights and cross-fit style movements such as dumbbell snatches. The pace for heavy weights should be slow and controlled to ensure proper form while lifting to avoid injury. This routine was an unprofessional mix of a complex movements being taught at a pace that was too fast to be safe and with no instruction or attention paid to the form of participants. Does it want to be a dance class or a weight lifting class, because you can't do both at the same pace. In addition, the trainers (Jason Wimberly and a new instructor who appeared annoyed by his controlling of her routine) seemed to be more concerned with their appearance and that of their participants than they were with the workout. Form, technique and safety are paramount in gym training classes. The ""pop-up"" aspect was the first sign this gym shouldn't be taken seriously.

I started attending classes when they were at their pop-up location. I was greeted by staff and trainers who made me feel welcome and at home in a new environment. I took the 1,2,3 Stack class and was instantly hooked. We focused on core, strength, and cardio (on the spins bikes). Every time I went back, I noticed that the staff always knew my name and the trainers were excited to start seeing me as a regular. Each trainer has their own style, flair, and flavor. The music choices vary from pop, to rock, to house, and everything in between and each class will certainly kick your butt! As soon as the new studio on La Brea opened, I made sure I was right back in the saddle (literally). I saw the trainers again and hugged them and told them how happy I was to be back. Within the time of going to The Wall, the people there always treated myself and the other members as family. They truly care about everyone who walks through their door and they ensure not only a kick-ass workout, but that you'll have a great time. Now they also have more classes (I have done them all!). There is the classic 1,2,3 Stack, STACKED (which focuses on core and strength), WIMBERRIDE (an intense 45 minute ride on the spin bikes), and STRETCH (where you focus on stretching the muscles that were definitely used during the other classes).

Their workout is centered around rowing: you start off with your regular row and are taught proper form (LOVE that they do this as I am a proponent of proper form over quantity), followed by sprints at varying intensities and different intervals. They have amazing WaterRowers which I feel provides for a smoother row and better resistance training. You also dive into some resistance training via resistance bands and some TRX.

Actually, most of the people didn't seem to know what they were doing half the time. 15minutes in I just decided to do my own thing and follow my own pace because I was worried I was actually going to injure myself. Another thing that was a bit annoying is that there was another guy in addition to the instructor whose only role was to cheer the class.

Their workout keeps my mind active and my body sweating. Their instructors are all top notch and their training regime is innovative and always evolving. They actually listen to feedback and apply it...ie challenges etc. In the room they have the main trainer and then a motivator that is getting you pumped up as well as making sure you are doing the exercises correctly. Another thing is that this workout is not ruining my knee's or joints but its still hard as hell.

I love their new look, and every member of the new staff has just blown me away by how friendly and approachable they are, which makes the workout that much better. I love that at Hype, individual instructors are getting to showcase their own music and exercise preferences while keeping the tight knit feel that YAS had and that kept customers coming back. I highly recommend one of their unlimited packages (until they come back to ClassPass at least!). Same deal- BYO towel and sneakers, but for $2 you can rent shoes. Spin classes leave you sweaty by song 1 and motivated throughout, no matter if there's one other person in the class or 12.

I've been going to this studio since 2015 back when it was YAS under different management. I loved it then, but it's nothing compared to the glory that is HYPE. The atmosphere, the positivity, the instructors, the community, the diversity of class offerings, and the class package deals are all amazing. I think the whole staff is incredible, but to single out some of my favorite instructors: Leah's the best yoga instructor I've ever had. She never phones it in, she's always completely present and deliberate in her teachings, & I always leave having learned something about myself or my body that I didn't know before. I take Chris' 45 minute Cycle class when I want to get my ass kicked. He's got great energy, great music, and is a master motivator. He'll challenge you and lift you up at the same time. Sheila's 30/30 spin/yoga combo class is another favorite of mine. She's got a really fun, diverse set of cycling ""choreography"" that keeps you on your toes. After in yoga, she knows all the right ways to stretch you out, leaving you feeling balanced and accomplished. I've also recently started taking Daniel's HIIT classes and they're the perfect combination of challenging and fun. Sometimes I'm still sore 48 hours after class, but it's well worth it!",QI2z3mzEdNBp9yW6jFksUw,Bianca U.,90027

He really loves the community and takes pride in the studio and assured me that the concern had been clarified and handled. What I love about the studio are the reasonable prices, the friendly instructors who remember your name and also the variety of classes. Most importantly the no judgement zone in the spin room. Spinning can be a very scary and cardio intensive thing and having an instructor that is both encouraging and chill makes a difference. Really love having the studio in the neighborhood. They also have really awesome HIIT, Barre and yoga classes. The best part is that your class packages covers all of them so you never get bored and can switch it up.

I was taking CoreStretch classes at Sweat Pilates for a while (which I loved), but I needed to find a place with classes I could fit into my schedule easier. I found Whole Body Method on Yelp and after doing some research, saw their fantastic deal on 3 one-on-one sessions. I submitted an email about my interest and got a call within hours from Madi. I set up an appointment for the following day with Meghan. I arrived early and filled out the medical history form. The space is gorgeous and extremely inviting, especially with the arched wooden ceiling (a good focus point for me while doing the exercises). The environment in some studios can seem very impersonal, but I didn't feel that way here at all. Meghan was wonderful - she went over some fundamentals (which I really, really needed) and did an assessment of me while I did performed some exercises on the mat. We did mat work for the first half of the session, then moved to the reformer. Some moves were familiar to me, while others weren't, but Meghan explained them all very thoroughly and quickly corrected me with a comment or touch when needed. Going into Tree (which I've never done before) was extremely intimidating, but once I broke through my fear, it felt absolutely amazing to open up my spine that way. We ended the session with some standing spinal stretches and I left feeling completely exhausted, but rejuvenated! I absolutely loved my session and have already booked my second one.",eRLaKcUElYAZlBodAB2Tlg,Julie S.,90019

I'm an accomplished athlete with some back issues. I'd thought about taking up Pilates for years, but just stuck to my same gym routine. Then, when we moved here last year, my girlfriend found Whole Body Gallery, and has loved it so much that's she's now in the process of being certified! Classes with her are only $20, you get to use ALL the equipment, AND she's flexible. I'm biased, of course, but it's been a terrific way for me to finally get into Pilates comfortably and in an affordable way. Thank you, Dawn and Nigel!",6q-8wxcHO2YhLqX-52oG7w,Chris R.,90019

I can't tell you what a difference this makes for me personally. I've got a long medical history and I've spent countless hours in a hospital bed, in and out of doctors offices, and had more surgeries than I can count. I am so grateful every time I can walk into that room because I am capable of doing so, and so proud to walk out of that room with my head held high having given it my all.

I absolutely love this place to work out really kills you, I have feel like I'm getting more strong on my sprints. I love the fact that they do interval training, you're constantly moving I believe I work out and burn up to 300 cal the entire time that I'm there, classes are about an hour. I am much slower than the rest of the class but I will get there! I love the environment, the kind staff members, the cleaners. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get in shape and  tone up. If you do make a  commitment, stick to it, you will see the results! My only issue is the the class schedule times, classes are a little difficult since they're at 5 am 6 am and the next class isn't until 7:20. Still worth it if arrange your schedule to match the classes. It's like Having a private trainer for a low budget with high-quality experience.
