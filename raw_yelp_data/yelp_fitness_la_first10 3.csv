The program UP created is intense but it was a relief talking to Geoff at the beginning because he recognized that my goal was a lifestyle change and I wanted to make sure those changes were more permanent. So, in terms of diet/nutrition, he simply encourages me to make as much work as possible and checks in on how I feel. When it comes to the actual weight training, he's definitely pushing me, but in a supportive way. I was initially worried that doing the same routines would bore me, but Geoff changes it up enough for me to not check out by having me pay attention more to my form, adding more weight to make it more challenging, and then surprising me with a new thing to do.",a6-8MDdefdwcdex4oYxd1A,Lennar M.,90025

As my Business improved i found myself stuck more behind a desk. First it was manageable i still made time to fit in some type of activity. Then work really started to take off i really found myself stuck behind a desk first one year went by then two then three before i knew it a decade went by. I lost the will and motivation to want to train. I know I'm not alone hear. I felt like crap became toxic and gained a bunch of weight feeling depressed just lack the will to interact became withdrawn really started to hate my life and what i allowed to happen. I always dabbled with research about fitness and even tried to kick start myself back into active life style. Boxed did cross-fit but then would get injured have to recover get better go get injured recover repeat repeat repeat until i just stopped altogether. Another year went by then two back to feeling sorry for myself didn't like where things had fallen once again. Then one day Browsing the internet came across and article about Ultimate Performance. they had tons of Before and afters photos . Never has any Gym shown such a record of success. I figured i need to try something so i set up an appointment meet with staff which by the way they are awesome.

Private instruction available (indoors and outdoors)","Los Angeles, CA 90064",5.0,Trainers,Parkour Classes Los Angeles,6,5,Cheviot Hills,8/18/2011,I started taking the PK classes last week and it was the best experience of my life. The instructors are really chill and make sure that you enjoy yourself while not hurting yourself and helping you learn your limits while learning elements of parkour. The instruction is well structured and honestly the class is very chill in the sense you do as much as you can and no one will look down on you for it. I am not very physically fit and so it's a nice environment to become so. I would reccomend this place to everyone. It's $15 every Thursday from 8:15pm-10:15pm. They cycle through 4 different classes in which you learn different elements of parkour. Be prepared if it's your first few times for the warm-ups to kick your ass. But it's totally worth it! I love this class and can't wait to go back!,mhIBozkoRBnfbt5l2f3PQA,Claire M.,90064

It was a bit hard to find initially. The workout is killer, I have gone to Chris and Laura (not the owner). I think Chris' workout is a little harder. I wasn't a big fan of Chris at the first class I took, maybe he was having a bad day but I took him a few more times and really liked his class. He is strict which is what you want. I really liked Laura because she is very attentive to position, will come over and make adjustments. I took a star off for the price, it's 40/class which is a bit high, even in the LA area. Hopefully I can figure out a package so I can keep going. The workout is definitely one what will have a positive impact on your body.",A0-aHYzhK-mqRl1O_rK3_Q,Jen C.,90049

You would here the same songs every day, and hearing the same songs sometimes made me really annoyed . They also would play sad songs  in the gyms music playlist . I suggest that fitness 19 never plays sad songs in a gym because it puts you in a tired and sad mood, and at the gym you always want to listen to hype music that gets you pumped up.

I started the 6 week boxing challenge at Boxing RX (formerly Los Feliz Boxing) at a rock bottom- I was at my heaviest and while I had never boxed before I had try something new. It was amazing! They start you off at the basics- learning all the different punches, foot work and movement you need to know and slowly progress in the combinations and workouts. Plus they provide you with a full, detailed meal plan which made it easy to stay on track and reframe my eating habits. I lost 8lbs and 4% body fat in those 6 weeks and over the last year and half I am down 15lbs. But more than that, I just love boxing. It doesn't feel a ""workout."" It feels like am training- developing a skill, constantly improving, getting faster, stronger, and more consistent. And, to add, during quarantine the coaches have continued to program zoom workouts which has been life saving. I need that accountability and the workouts truely get me through the day.

I liked that I could workout, shower and leave within 35 minutes but the personal attention was the best part. At first, they keep a close eye on you to make sure you're keeping the proper form, it's almost like a one-on-one workout, but as you get more used to it the trainers won't hover as much. You'll think that they're not paying attention but the second you start to use bad form, someone is there correcting you. And if you're coasting, they'll be putting more weight on the machine, making sure you get the most out of every workout, or giving you an additional exercise to keep pushing you but without any drill sgt. theatrics.",CMy3aiIk8jUHKRUsCqwg3A,Jay S.,90071

Definitely guiding me toward building a solid foundation before we start banging out the weights. Now more limber and strong than I have ever been. And taking the time to do things properly.

When she worked with me, she evaluated me as a whole person -- personality, preferences and habits, dietary habits and mental state -- and responded with a fitness and nutrition agenda based on all those factors on any given day. I was in the midst of a big move while we were working together, so my stress levels were high, and my physical activity (other than packing boxes) was pretty low. She was present and really participated with me while I was working out, and she was extremely attuned to the details of my body mechanics, constantly adjusting me or the exercises for maximum benefit.

Nothing helped. So I signed up for the free trial. It was intense! I wasn't totally sure I could handle it, but there was an amazing 2 week deal for $69. After the second class, my back pain was totally gone! Unbelievable! I was hooked! You see results fast and that keeps motivating you to keep going back. Toner, stronger more flexible body. It's even motivated me to a healthier diet and helped me lose a ton of weight. I got to be honest, it's intimidating walking in those doors.

Spartan yoga is especially great after Crossfit or barre classes because it utilizes foam rollers for the ultimate stretch out, or should I say, smash out.  Lastly, if all these options aren't for you, there are brand new treadmills, stair steppers, ellipticals and typical resistance and strength gym equipment.  Came in for Thrill Summer Olympics 2016!

Calls my sister obese in front of everyone can you imagine going in to get help from people and then being humiliated in front of complete strangers !

Now customer service, everyone was amazing and so friendly. They truly make you feel comfortable. Now the class. Ok this might be long... my best friend were trained by AJ and he was strict but fun and motivating. He really made us work out. I'm not gonna lie I hate exercising and now I'm overweight so this was not easy. However I actually can't wait for my next session which is in one day.

The hours! On yelp it says open at 6am at the actual place it says 9am yet no one is there till about 11am. Today I showed up at 9:50 no one was there and outside were two other members I see often they left when I did. This is very disappointing because I'm paying for a service and not getting my money's worth. 2. The machines!! Man oh man there is 3 machines I can't use because they have been broken from what another guy told me they have out for a couple months. This limits everyone's workouts. 3. When I signed up I was asked to come back for my member ID so I can log scan in its been 3 weeks now and I still don't have an ID I have the app but nothing to scan with because none of the guys know how to do it. There was a girl at the front desk and she herself didn't know what to do!! So what is she there for??! I like this gym because it's close by and not crowded but I don't think I'll keep my membership after it's done.,LeW62N8GAW7TaEHauSWaBQ,Yuri G.,91204

But on top of that, INCREDIBLY unfriendly and super old equipment (which, fine, I would not care if it weren't for the smell and the horrible vibe). Showed up as a potential member and was barely greeted. The guy that appeared to be one of the trainers (or owners? Not sure) didn't even introduce himself or explain even in the slightest, how they operate. I've been to several independent smaller gyms but this one was by far the worst one. So dirty, so unfriendly, smelled SO bad, such bad energy, and the most unsanitary looking bathrooms ever (squalor). Not sure how this place got five stars.

,1334 San Fernando Rd,5.0,"Gyms,Boxing",Suicide Boxing + Fitness,49,5,,1/10/2018,"I can't say enough of how grateful I am to the Owner and Master Trainer Diego Lopez for his support and direction in helping me achieve my weight/health goals!!! He is not only a trainer but a motivator! Although it is a class setting, Diego makes it feel like a private session -- he knows everyone's name and sees EVERYTHING you are doing!!! He is truly gifted and his motivational speeches through the workout pushes me to give 110% even when I feel like giving up.  I've been with Suicide Boxing since 2010 but due to an accident in 2016 I was sidelined and gained 50 pounds. I was able to return to Suicide Boxing in January 2017 and needed to shed this excess weight. Diego put me on a plan where I had to lose 1-pound per week and weigh in every Monday. The stipulation was if I didn't lose 1-pound a week I owed him 100 burpees or 100 squats.  Yes, I owed him a few times :-). I'm happy to report as of January 10, 2018, I've lost a total of 37 pounds, a gang of inches and close to 8% body fat!  Check out the pics!!! Diego is amazing and his main message is about living a healthy lifestyle. What sticks with me the most is when he says, ""it's up to you -- it's about consistency in the gym and consistency with a healthy diet! And working out 1 hour per day is only 4% of your day!""",JxGC2GnF3bZQ0qop5zMoIQ,Sheryl T.,91340

Another reason I love this place is as a girl sometimes going to the gym it's a little bit intimidating and you don't feel as comfortable but here the vibe is so good and everyone is so respectful you don't feel out of place or uncomfortable! ,2MGVpBnOTEcQDDGkimiuAw,Lizbeth G.,91340

Last year I found this little gem in San Fernando that does just that! Diego (the owner & trainer) really cares about all of his clients and has made it his mission to push us to our full potential every single time we set foot in his gym. I started going with one of my girlfriends to help each other stay on track & because some of the work outs require a partner. Suicide boxing is like a family and even if you don't know the person standing next to you if you need help they'll help you, motivate & give you that extra push that you need to get the work out done. So if you don't have a work out buddy to start of with you can always count on somebody in the class.

First of all I have never left a yelp review but I felt Winning Image deserves an applause . Maria referred me to Leonor... she said Leonor would be able to help me. I started training with Leonor to help me with my sciatic problems I had for the past 5 yrs which prevented me to workout. I had tried many things including therapy, chiropractor sessions and still I wasn't able to do simple workout moves like walk, jog, not even squat moves. I've always been a very active mom of 2 boys 18 and 7 year old until I developed sciatic pain. Just so you all get an idea of how bad the sciatic pain was, let me just say I couldn't even walk for 1 hour without having pain in my lower back, down my thigh to the knee. Extreme pain that would last about a week and it would affect me sleep as well. I started building a lot of stress, tension, frustration and due to that weight gain. My eating was not a problem, I don't eat junk food or fast food. I went from 125 lbs to 160 lbs (went from size 2 to a size 10) and believe me I tried many, many ways to loose weight and help my sciatic but no success. Leonor has helped me so much and the best part is I can see myself loosing the weight with sciatic pain relief. I am able to workout with Leonor for 1 hour without sciatic pain then go home and sleep like a baby. Last weekend I wore a Medium dress to a wedding not stretchy material. I bought this dress to wear to my sons graduation 7 months ago, I love it but I didn't fit in it. So I tried it last week and I was so amazed how well it fit. In just three weeks of training work 3 times a week and I feel amazing... I feel happy just like I used to feel about my body 5 years ago. I feel great!!!!.... also the prep meals are delicious! ..... thank so much Maria, Leonor Lori and Scott you are all amazing!!!",-B3w8KmacqNcPMPMbmjreg,Marisa R.,90242

I like the change of pace when you get off the bike and go to the mat for weights. So a few tips, first workout at your own pace when you're on the bike. The girls there know what they're doing and have worked up their endurance. This was my first time ever cycling and first time working out in 2 yrs. I was not able to do what they were doing and that's ok. I didn't quit I just cycled on at my own pace. I will get there eventually. Second, bring water lots of water and a towel. You will need it. And lastly keep at it. Half the battle is going! I will definitely be back for another class. Might try their cycling sculpt class that's cycling with weights.

After the class I went to the front desk because I didn't see that they charged me for the class. Come to find out it was a ""community"" class.

,1396 E Washington Blvd,4.5,"Weight Loss,Centers,Trainers,Boot Camps",The Camp Transformation Center Pasadena,406,2,,1/14/2020,"I found out about this gym through my brother. I looked it up and decided to try it out for 3 days prior to agreeing to any sort of membership. I had loved the idea that it was like a class setting and that you have  trainers there to assist you and answer any questions. Eventually, I decided to get the membership instead of one of those challenges because all I wanted was a little motivation and some tips on how to properly work out especially with weights. I was paying about 100 a month for about 7 months until I decided to cancel. There was a couple reasons for my decision. First of all, during the summer their AC always breaks and you're stuck working out in what feels like a sauna. During the winter the place is freezing! I'm not sure if they fixed the problem but honestly it was a nightmare. Also, most of the place is carpet which is kind of disgusting because people's sweat literally soaks in there. Not sure how often they clean it but most of the time the carpet didn't look very clean. The gym is also pretty small and it's the worst when class sizes are on the larger side. There is also no mirrors which is odd because it's a gym and I feel like mirrors are necessary in order to correct your form. Another reason why I left was due to some of the trainers. At the beginning I really enjoyed class with every single one of them but towards the end of my time there they hired new trainers whom I didn't really enjoy class with. There was also an incident where one of the newer trainers made me feel a little uncomfortable and that was basically the last straw and I decided to just cancel. So after taking like two classes with him he found me on social media. Not once did I give him my last name or speak to him on a personal level. The only way he would of found me would of been through searching my full name on their computer system which is honestly kinda creepy. I thought the whole incident was pretty unprofessional and inappropriate. Anyway, when I finally tried to cancel my membership I was told I had to give them a 30 day notice prior to canceling. Honestly the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. They made me pay a whole month after. Ridiculous. Overall, I would not recommend this gym. Some of the trainers are amazing but the whole gym itself isn't worth the amount of money you'll be paying.",_tZ-ICnpc92IweTsqEhBvw,Sandra S.,91104

The exercises are doable and is done circuit style so I don't have a hard time doing cardio exercises. The support and family in their fb group was god sent.

And that's alright if you don't care about that stuff. It just wasn't for me. I didn't go to the boxing floor, so I can't comment on that. They also offer one yoga class, that I also didn't try. I'll have to pass, but thanks for letting me check it out. Btw, there is free parking, as well as  P.O. boxes if you so desire.",TkemqWpShaxwsRgrlo0V1w,Syndeeee B.,90028

I remember telling him I don't want to get bulky by lifting weights. He said you're an idiot that's not how it works (we're not together anymore) He was right I was toned as hell the best body I ever had and weighed more than I ever had. So confusing right?

I first discovered this school when I was living/working in NYC. The founder, Kim, was offering classes there at the time, and I stumbled upon them when I was searching for pole dancing classes. SXT didn't offer pole classes but instead they offered more practical classes like lap dance and striptease. These are classes that teach you how to dance using just your body and maybe a chair and/or your clothing as props. In other words, no pole necessary (because how many of us have a pole at home?!)!  I took my first class in Spring 2013 and I was hooked. The instructors were fantastic (and patient), and the students were great as well. Everyone was very helpful and supportive, and the ladies at SXT were like a family. When I moved to LA a year later SXT was one of the things I missed most about NY. But now SXT's wonderful founder is living and teaching here in LA (woohoooooo!)! Her classes not only offer a very serious workout (ouch!) but they also make you feel good about and more comfortable with/confident in yourself in the process. And you actually learn how to dance! Definitely worth your time. You can't go wrong.",JOkK6aqny0DylwjcWQgiJQ,Tasha B.,90027

As it is, we brought our own colored backdrops and lighting (there WAS lighting there, but we didn't get told what we could/couldn't use, so we just used our own) and that made the shoot easier. Overall, its a cool space if you WANT the super unique backdrops and sets they have built, but I would suggest being clear about what you need/want so you show up that day and the sets you want are ready to go.",Zk20WqxxH8yv94B1nJM8Sg,Melissa R.,90023

(at 41 yrs old) and it was all done in my own home without fancy equipment. It was just hard work and amazing technique that showed me Lalo was really paying attention to my movement and execution so I got the most out of our sessions. He even did all of this working with my back issues since I have a torn disk in my lower back and I knew I would need core strength to carry a pregnancy. Additionally he helped me work out a meal plan and spent time showing me some great recipes for my morning shake and lunch and dinner meals.  I genuinely believe the work we did helped not only got my body ready for pregnancy, but once I was pregnant, the core strength gained helped mitigate back issues I might have encountered during pregnancy.  That said, of course once I had my son I called Lalo and lost those 20 lbs. again.  ",pPnD3vUraXJVBdhZejzk4A,Sonia Q.,90048

""A workout you'll look forward to"" - SHAPE Magazine",8471 Beverly Blvd,4.5,Trainers,"Lalo Fuentes, CSCS Personal Trainer",14,5,Beverly Grove,8/23/2017,"I trained with Lalo before and during pregnancy.  He really knows how to meet very personal individual goals.  He knows how to help gain muscle and strength while leading up to pregnancy, maintain my strength and energy during pregnancy, and whip you back into shape after the birth of a baby.  I had abs within 3 weeks of giving birth!  I attribute that to all of the maintenance training we did throughout pregnancy.  My Dr. was even very impressed at how in shape I was during my pregnancy.  Lalo is very easy to be around, and has a very unique method that will build muscle and strength without completely tiring you out.  He's very professional, always punctual and he's a great coach and motivator.  He focuses  not only on fitness training but asks about and offers advice regarding nutrition and overall health goals...physical and mental.  He also trained my husband who had very different goals than me.  I highly recommend Lalo for so many different types of training goals!",-PdlkliXw28t7WQL9dKFhQ,Rebecca R.,90048

""A workout you'll look forward to"" - SHAPE Magazine",8471 Beverly Blvd,4.5,Trainers,"Lalo Fuentes, CSCS Personal Trainer",14,5,Beverly Grove,6/27/2011,"I've worked out with Lalo off and on (mostly on) since December, 2007.  I shed about 30 pounds and got ripped.  I've maintained well.  I always find that when I go to him, my muscles tone and my whole body responds.  I move it up to a new level of fitness.  I've worked out with a few trainers in the last five years, and Lalo is the most skilled and capable of them all.  He motivates me to excel and challenges me at each workout.  He really pays attention to my technique - even after three years.  Most people would get into a routine and let their clients go on autopilot.  I appreciate how much he dedicates himself to fitness and health.  We do a food plan each week that he checks when we work out.  It keeps me away from the pancakes and banana creme pie.  His food log is a great idea - and the system works very well (although it is very simple).  Thanks Lalo!",NnrpcpiUz4p-A-LfJp2NUQ,Duke L.,90048

After going through most of my life out of shape and feeling like I wasn't living up to my physical (emotional, spiritual, professional) potential, I started training with Ryan after a referral from a close friend. Before working with Ryan I would always push myself way too hard and quickly burn out or injure myself. With Ryan he gave me a completely different outlook on why I was training. My mission when starting with Ryan had superficial foundations, but quickly evolved to a focus on a lifetime of health and wellness. Ryan was so helpful and always there for me when I had questions about any of the exercises or about the adjustments I was making to my nutrition. With Ryan's continued support and encouragement I started to really feel the positive impact of the work I was putting in. The best part of training with Ryan is that not only have I gotten to the best physical and mental health of my life, but I feel like I've gained a true friend and brother in the process. Ryan genuinely cares so much about each of his clients and is willing to go above and beyond to serve their needs. He continues to educate himself to evolve routines, inform of new techniques, and continues to evaluate the client to evolve the training regimen. There's no ""one-size-fits-all"" with Ryan and he personalizes everything for each client. I could go on forever about all the ways Ryan has helped me, but if you're one of those people who's frustrated where they're at and doubts whether or not you can get where you want to go, then do yourself the biggest favor and seek the help and knowledge Ryan is ready and willing to share. After working with Ryan for almost 2 years, whether it be in person or through his coaching app, I'm so grateful to have him in my life and am excited for what's ahead on this journey.

"Online tutoring using Zoom is available!

I specialize in self-defense instruction and tutoring math, science (physics, chemistry, biology), and electrical engineering.  The style of self-defense that I teach is based mainly on fighting methods taught to Allied commandos during World War Two, plus some techniques taught to CIA officers, US Army Special Forces, and US Marines.  This is simple, practical, brutally effective self-defense, NOT MMA or sport fighting.  Many techniques that I teach would be illegal in a sporting match.

Need help preparing for a standardized test like the SAT or AP exams?  I can help!  I have extensive experience helping students prepare for standardized tests as well as general schoolwork.  I am especially good at algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.  For those in physics, my strongest area is electric circuits.

The instructors I've had here are wonderful, and I love the variety of classes they offer. I actually agree with gripes voiced by other Yelpers: the cost is definitely too high and was just raised again, and the lack of any sign up list or class cap makes classes during certain dates and times unbearable during the school year (I still have flashbacks to a 10am Saturday YogaSculpt class where sweaty students were packed so close that every mat touched...ick.)

The exercises themselves are not very difficult on their own but when done for an hour straight in a room that's 90 degrees, it really is a great workout. The classes are pretty intense and it will take a while to build up the endurance to do the entire hour without taking breaks here and there - so don't get discouraged. The thing that I like so much about this workout is that even though you worked your butt off for the entire hour, you don't really feel too sore the next day - so you can easily go on back-to-back days.

A lot of the USC students who make up 90% of the clientele are loud/disrespectful to the practice. Also, someone else's sweat inevitably will land on your mat and puddle; this happens way too often here because the teachers let more people in then there should be and the college students are entitled/oblivious about personal space. Call me old-fashioned but if we're swapping sweat I should at least know your name. I can't mountain pose because I'm squeezed against a wall, horse pose otherwise my ass would be by a stranger's crotch, or airplane pose because I could possibly kick a head (sorry woman from 2019 May's 4pm class). They need better organization and an earlier admittance cutoff to actually make the practice enjoyable/less claustrophobic. I also wished they were cleaner. The tissues in the bathroom or studio rooms aren't always stocked. I saw an employee use a white towel to clean the bathroom stalls, so that was more than enough to stop me from renting their towels.

This is the only studio I've been to with about 4 different types of pilates equipment.  I met one of the owners Nika and she was really nice as well. The studio is kind of small so the classes are small and intimate which is actually better. There's only street parking but I didn't have a hard time finding parking.

My wife and I took 10 dance lessons with Krista and Kelvin in preparation for our first dance -- we were both super nervous about our first dance and we were nervous about taking dance lessons as well. Fortunately, we found Krista and Kelvin and they created a dance sequence for us (based on our vision), they taught us several different styles of dance (in easy to digest bits), and they created an audio file of our two songs (with edits) that we gave to our DJ to play on our wedding night. We had an absolute blast at the dance lessons, they were the highlight of our wedding planning. We also crushed the first dance as Krista and Kelvin did such a marvelous job prepping us. We plan to return to Krista and Kelvin in the future to take more dance lessons.

Being a personal trainer is not a pastime job while he waits to become an actor, as I have found with so many other trainers. He has been a personal trainer for over 25 years and it is his career. John is atop of all the latest exercise and diet craze and will educate if it is a positive or negative ""fad"". He is very knowledgeable about my particular needs and how to get me to work out to get the best results. In the past other personal trainers I have worked with had me start out doing heavy weighs and exercises that caused me injuries because they exercise everyone,( no matter the age and condition) the same way. John takes into consideration, age, shape, condition and goals to set a personalized plan just for me, unlike some cookie-cutter ""personal trainers"".  John is down to earth, friendly and truly loves seeing his clients get results.

Again, I must reiterate that I am completely new to CrossFit and I can admit that I was sometimes that 'deer in the headlights' student - I knew that I needed to learn the vocabulary, but most importantly, I wanted to make sure that I was doing the correct moves in order to prevent injury. The 101 classes was a perfect mix of instruction, along with the ability to ask questions (and I did ask to repeat what the coach said a few times). Believe me, you can still get a full on workout in these 101 classes, maybe not as much as the regular class that is going on next to you at the same time, but you can for sure expect to sweat while taking it at your own pace. My goal was to complete the 101 courses in a month and then move on to the regular classes, but I feel that I would still need/want another month of 101 classes. Unfortunately, my work schedule has changed and its thrown a wrench in my CrossFit machine and will have to push it out another month, but once all settles, I am looking forward to coming back....with the goal of graduating into taking the regular classes, and then of course having the liberty to take those classes at different times rather than the set 7pm 101 classes.

I didn't realize that day would be the day that I would change my life. I had lost weight before and kept it off for years but I had let myself go lately and needed help getting back on track. ,k_6T3GzwJ4CjkxSq8PuRJg,Anet H.,91042

I've belonged to gyms and have taken many different classes in the past..yoga, spin, etc. FBBC was advertising a 10wk Challenge. It sounded perfect for me. I joined and realized it was so much more than just an exercise class. I was instantly welcomed by many, encouraged, motivated and inspired. There are several class times a day to choose from and you can take as many as you like 6 days a week at 2 locations- Tujunga and Burbank. Each day is very different focusing on different body areas, endurance, strength, power and conditioning. It's a HIIT program and you work in circuits. The actual workouts after group discussions and group warm-up (15 min) are 30 minutes, so 45 minute sessions,  which was perfect for me! The coaches are inspirational and caring. You learn a lot about yourself, your physical capabilities as well as mental toughness. In under 10 weeks I could get up off the floor without using my hands and run a 5k, as well as gain over 2 pounds in muscle and lose over 2% body fat with their nutritional guidance, including calories and macro distributions. I have been so impressed that I just signed a 1 year membership. It is like joining a fit family with lots of encouragement, high 5s, and team work.

Corey (the owner) along with the coaches and Corey's wife have taught me to have a healthy relationship with food and myself. You need to eat and you need to eat a lot if you want your body to change. Who knew?! I no longer care what the scale says, I am more focused on my body fat and muscle gain. I am learning to love myself. This place has given me so much, beyond health and fitness. It has given me dreams of becoming a better person, reaching my  life's goals and has gifted me with new friendships. I wish I could give this place more stars.

,395 Santa Monica Pl,4.5,"Shoe Stores,Fitness,Instruction",Nike Santa Monica Run Club,12,5,,7/18/2016,So today the speedy Jessica and I decided to try a long run with Nike in Santa Monica.  They had a variety of paces and distances.  I opted for a 6 mile run and of course Jess said I'll do 13  lol well it was kinda awesome. I always seem to run into people I know. Ok so after a warm up and a little stretching it was off to the races. And you all know it's hard for me to pace with people but I stayed with my pacer.  Discipline was the word of the day. I enjoyed the run along the beach and just focused. I started getting thirsty at mile 1.5 I'm always thirsty. I'll carry water next time. Ok we got to the turn around and headed back. That's when shit hit the fan. At about 4.8 miles we came across these bad ass stairs. We went up these stairs. I thought I was gonna die.  Come to find out we made a wrong turn but got extra workout. We stopped got some water then headed in for the final  lap. I started to fall behind. The 6:30 pacer stayed with me and we talked about running and injuries and all the good stuff runners talk about. Well we caught up and came in and finished strong. While waiting for Jessica to come back I learned more about running and just listening to to our body. Well today was a good run. I can tell because my legs where sore when I finished.  I'll be back next week for more. The coaches told me to bring all of LA next week. The coaches and pacers are a awesome group. And very knowledgable.,Ssqk2amhCoFZqK3rX7fruA,Peter F.,90401

(3) The energy of the BMX clinic is zen. Whether it's the Japanese inspired decor running throughout the clinic or the indoor/outdoor design of the main work out floor or the warm positive energy of the staff, I always feel good when I am at BMX.  It's not a meat market like other gyms.  The clientele at BMX are serious about working out.  (4) It's so clean!!! The women's locker room is like a locker room at a Burke Williams spa...fresh towels, Umberto shampoo and conditioner, hair ties, Q-tips, hair spray, lotion, perfume, fabulous magazines (French Vogue...oh la la).  (5) BMX caters to working professionals.  There are conference rooms and wi-fi (not to mention the fresh coffee) so you can work while waiting for your session.

The answer for me is Tibor and his team at Life Boost Fitness.  It's a work out to be sure, but it is exercise my way based on my needs, my body type and what I like to do.  Much of the time that I've spent with Tibor is about life beyond just the traditional work out.  He has continually monitored my eating habits and gently guided me in a better nutritional direction. It's not a ""diet"" that is being recommended but a way for me to eat fully with recommendations for cooking at home and eating out.  I've received great assistance in coming up with things that I can cook over the weekend and take to work with me to eat for lunch.   There has been counseling for how much sleep I get, how to manage stress and how I can both set and achieve real goals.  It would be inaccurate to say that Life Boost Fitness has just provided me with a personal trainer for exercise, instead, it's a personalized 360 healthy lifestyle plan with my own coach standing beside me every step of the way.  I've changed for the better and I've become a healthier person through Life Boost Fitness.",5WNoIjpkigkgaUzJgmtJyA,Matthew H.,90211

In particular, eliminating the self study ""certification"" element, and putting aspiring trainers in a classroom, where they'll learn from experienced individuals in the fitness industry. In addition to that, raising the bar for trainers to be held to the same accountability as any and every other profession. I was about 3 months into studying for my NASM-CPT(self study) when I found Show Up Fitness through social media. It was clear to me that their program was far superior than anything that I was studying at the time. I took in my first client shortly after passing the NASM exam, and trained said client for 5 weeks.  I had to be honest with myself  that I wasn't ready to train so I reached out to Show Up Fitness, and became one of their online interns shortly after. Since joining, I've been able to get some in person training sessions while being supervised by experienced trainers, consult with social media specialists about how to build my own brand online, shadow some of the top trainers and physical therapists in the industry, and listen to interviews from various managers at some of the top gyms.  And if that's not enough, we're also learning advanced anatomy, human movement, and how to do nutritional consultations, the body mass equation and a ton more. My confidence in myself to be a great trainer is up 1000% since joining the internship.",kBgRb0BNdESGAY8-exAOsQ,Carlos C.,90046

This is a very nice place to go to. It's definitely not for those who are taking their first ballet class ever. The ballet classes are intermediate - advanced. I mean - come on- nobody is going to take 20 minutes to teach you the basic stuff. All the other classes are for any level I would say. I also like Pilates reformers classes. I am happy their classes run all day, so you can always find a class for your schedule. The studio has a/c and heater, which is awesome! It's bright and cozy. I wish they would play more classical music, but getting out of my comfort zone is fine too. ;) All of the instructors are very beautiful, fit and talented!

All classes were designed to complement one another.",8376 Beverly Blvd,4.0,"Pilates,Opera,Ballet,Trainers",Ballet Bodies,40,3,Beverly Grove,7/11/2019,"I used to love this place. I've gone on and off for years. To make a long story short...2 years ago I bought a $300+ class package. In my first class of the package (I had been before to Ballet Bodies when it was on ClassPass, not sure if it still is, and I have taken ballet as a teen and as an adult for 20 years), I seriously injured my calf muscle. The instructor was flippant when I told her. That sucked but I was ok with taking accountability for my body and choices. I went to my doctor immediately after and was told I needed to wear a medical boot along with physical therapy to heal. So I did. Then I got pregnant and had an insanely rough pregnancy. Physically rough. Baby is here now. I am still doing physical therapy because my body took a big hit from the injury and from labor and healing has been a slow road for me. My therapist said I could go back to doing ballet and stretching. I walked into Ballet Bodies twice to resume my class package after explaining my life. The first gal didn't get back to me at all. The second wrote me a short email about how they won't honor the package I bought. I guess it expired after a year. Which I will now only go to places where there is not an expiration date. And I asked if they could make an exception since I hurt myself in their class initially and I have the documentation to show my timeline and injuries etc. Nope. Didn't matter. I even asked for just half of the classes to be honored since I really couldn't come to ballet this entire time. Still no. I feel that from a guest relations standpoint, what's the harm in being cool and just honoring a class package? If anything I would have bought more classes and praised your awesomeness to everyone. But now I just feel like for a small business to be so stingy is so lame and if I hear the words:: ""our policy is..."" a little piece of me dies. This spot is so far removed from being cool and treating people with love and respect that it feels like money comes first. To the new owner of Ballet Bodies...I'm not sure why you make the choices you make but I'll take my pirouettes elsewhere. Much love.",xuGWSoA4xWum7mH1kFlH8Q,Ming N.,90048

I was immediately struck by how knowledgeable she was about Fletcher-style pilates, which was new to me at the time. I always knew that in her classes I was going to work very hard, but feel amazing for days afterward. Eventually I moved away, and it was no longer possible for me to continue attending her classes. After trying, unsuccessfully, to find high-quality pilates instruction around the city, I tracked Eve down again, and discovered that she had gone out on her own and was providing individual instruction out of a cozy studio in the LA equestrian district. Though it's a bit out of the way for me, it's worth it for me to brave the extra drive time. I've been going to Eve 3 days a week for almost a year now, and I'm not looking back! As always, she pushes you hard, but never in an unsafe way. She tailors each workout to what is going on with your body that day. She is extremely well-trained in Fletcher-style, as well as other modalities and is constantly looking for ways to fine tune her practice. Whether you're a beginner or someone who has been doing pilates for years, I can't recommend her highly enough.

The receptionist does have some pride issues as other yelpers have pointed out and makes you feel like they are doing you a favor providing care for you. What bugs me the most though is that my PT session is always cut by 5-10 minutes. When they book patients, they book them back to back without any room for breaks. If the previous patient asks one extra question or the therapist needs to print something out or just take a bathroom break, they cut into your time, you will always start LATE but finish ON TIME. It's already a shorter session to begin with (30 min), you lose another 5-10 min, your session ends up being only 20+ min long, and the therapist usually asks about things and take notes for about 10 min.

Since I started the yoga program with Laurie Hutter it has been a game changer for me. The very first session was awesome and I became physically addicted to the yoga workouts. My breathing, back pain, neck, joint issues have all improved in just a few short  weeks. I have more energy so I exercise when I wake up and before I go to bed which is great for me the retiree. The exercises are low impact and easy to duplicate.  Just watch the instructor who makes it easy. Laurie is a great teacher who has the ability to encourage, support, and inspire her students in a very upbeat and positive way. The results from yoga for me has been physically positive and mentally enjoyable.I would encourage all persons to take this class for all of the hidden rewards, gems, and treasures within you!

I was tired of the routine of the gym. Even with a personal trainer I never felt like I was maximizing my time.  Now in 30 minutes I feel like I've accomplished all of my needs. Cardio, Strength, and Muscle toning. I'm over 50 and this class keeps me going but doesn't make me want to hit the oxygen tank. Chris and Zach are excellent motivators! I love the small groups because it's like having your own trainer yet having enough people to keep you entertained while you're working out. I don't feel intimidated like I do in large gyms. It feels like just a group of friends getting together and doing something great for themselves. Everybody has high energy and is incredibly friendly. I'm sort of reluctant to post great things about this place because I'm afraid too many people will want to go. But I thought I'd share the wealth.

I had a tough time finding a studio that I felt the workout was complete enough to commit to a membership. The results I've achieved the past 5 months at Sweat City says it all in comparison to my past memberships (Orange Theory, Barry's, Daily Method & Corepower Yoga). Their USP really is their ability to train and push you to your personal challenge point. Unlike the main stream studios I went to before, they modify exercises (without frustration or judgment) to be mindful of your injuries and to target your own fitness goals. Classes really fly by because the coaches (and everyone in them) are hilarious and bring great energy. The coaches are all great with slightly different styles, so I recommend trying them all to see what works best for you. Cheers, Yasmeen.",utQIzSHJhyrM0JUD3jNNVQ,Yasmeen D.,90405

Four months ago I turned 60 and, very unhappy with my current state of health and fitness, found David O'Donnell and the Egoscue Method of eliminating pain through postural exercises. When I started, my goals were simply to be able to get up from the floor without a struggle, pick up something from the floor without hesitation and to hike in the hills again, something I hadn't been able to do for seven years due to back, hip, knee and ankle pain. I also was hampered by plantar fasciitis in my left foot, which was constantly painful. I figured it would take a long time, maybe a year, to get to the point where I could hike again. David gave me a simple set of exercises to do every morning, most of which actually feel good. FOUR MONTHS LATER, I took my first hike in Griffith Park in seven years, an hour-long hike, half of which was uphill. I came home, spent 10 minutes in an easy passive stretch (static back) and had no soreness or injury and now the hike is a regular thing! My plantar fasciitis is not painful and when something falls on the floor, I can bend over and pick it up without worrying about my back or my balance. I can get up from the floor without grabbing onto something and pulling myself up. Because I can do these things, I now have a more positive outlook on my life and my future. Instead of seeing myself caught in a downward spiral of declining health and fitness, I see myself in an upward spiral, getting stronger and more capable. Being pain free and having hope for the future is priceless. DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT DAVID.",YvWCB3DOHbTd6PLGCdMjrA,Carole R.,90027

I cannot wait to return to CA and for him to come to NYC for a massage there. Thanks! Leith Hill",7zhbydUWhhABNghhP1jdaA,Leith H.,90048

"BDA's training is like none other. The passion for kids and attention to detail is what sets our training staff ahead of pack. Our students must complete a thirty minute commitment meeting with our staff prior to our commitment to train. We need assurance each student is making the commitment to train on their own and will submit to doing the hard work it takes to develop to their fullest potential. After our meeting we will go to the court for a full evaluation which is documented on video for future review. When the evaluation is complete we will discuss anything we see that needs to be improved upon, what needs to be done to correct them and how it's going to be done step-by-step. As player development advances we will continue to document through video each student progress to compare to earlier footage to show growth. Each student will be responsible for completing 30 minute of basketball homework each day which will be given by our training staff. training is progressive and the homework given is mandatory. We guarantee our training results 100%. Our students are also held to strict academic standards to assist with their college recruiting process.

He shows favoritism to certain box members. I have witnessed and experienced: Johnny gaslighting, banning, and ghosting members. He only communicates when it's good for him or suits his interests. There are two main sides to Johnny: the salesman or businessman. He doesn't lead by example whether that be with what's been mentioned above or his own fitness. Repeatedly, he falls short.

I have taken pilates back in the day, have run two marathons, have taken spin classes twice a day. But, in the last few years, I pulled back because I moved and could no longer afford Equinox. In the pulling back, I focused on Kundalini yoga and walking. However, in my most recent move, I have lost my yoga studio and walking space.  I needed to find  a place to workout. I happened to pass the Eagle Rock location a few times, and saw the Pasadena one. ",V3s_Act8xNJiDL8rXdvMig,M. M.,91101

I decided to do a 5 week challenge at the gym. I am in the middle of that challenge right now. I have been very happy with my results so far. I don't eat meat so the owner sat with me and adjusted the meal plan to be plant based so that I could be successful. I am a very strict about what I put in my body. I do not consume any artificial sweeteners or artificial colors. I was bummed that three out of the four products included in the challenge have artificial colors and sweeteners in them. However, the owners did also switch them out for me with cleaner products. When I am done with this challenge I hope to join as a member.

At the time he couldn't take new clients but said he may be able to squeeze me in late at night, however he had to check with his wife first . I guess his wife is the business owner . He said he was unable at the time. Two months later I called him again , which took him over 5 days to return my phone call. He scheduled an appointment and on the morning of the appointment as a courtesy I texed him, again I texed him, not vise verse and his respond immediately was he was feeling sick and he had to cancel all his appointments for the day and that IF I WANTED to reschedule I could . Again remember he is the business owner not me. Seemed like he didn't want new clients soooo IF I WANTED to reschedule I could. I responded yes and if next week would work which I got no response back. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, that he was SICK. On the same day that he was sick, I saw him posting on his Instagram that he was working out and having a banana, the same day he canceled on his new client. Well if you don't want to take new clients you should remove your Yelp or be honest with your potential clients instead of giving them the run around . It's that simple. Let's just say I catch people lie, steal and conduct fraud for a living and you my friend Jorge didn't do a good job in lying to a potential new client. Very unprofessional. I would not recommend him.",UtTfucSpELU66Gg-0OFi1A,Evet M.,91505

I've joined several gyms over the years and then never actually went. So I hesitantly thought I'd give this whole personal trainer thing a try. Four months later, to my absolute surprise, I'm actually enjoying working out! Jorge at My Fit Studio is great! I show up and do the sets with the weights he sets up for me, no guessing, no stressing. And with the extra encouragement to safely push heavier weights, I'm actually seeing results for the first time in literally years and years.

I must say I made a great decision because he is a great trainer and a great dude. He takes the time to personalize the work outs, will follow up with you after your workouts to see how you're feeling, and is very knowledgeable when it comes to nutrition.

He is good natured but has the ability to push and inspire all at the same time. Every class is always different and it's never boring. Classes are a brisk 50 minutes and it is always a WORKOUT (you know, the kind where your face is red and you're sweating in a way that never happens when it's just you and a treadmill). It's mostly women who belong with some men here and there. Everyone is lovely and at different abilities. It's just a good vibe. Though I've been going just twice a week since August (with some time away for work travel), I have noticed differences in my body and strength.

The ease of signing on to his Zoom classes keeps me logging on, but what keeps me coming back week after week are the results (less back tension, more flexibility, and -yes- stronger core/glutes/thighs that are sore in the best way possible). This is the re-set my body needs after working 8-6 in my home office. The precision of Mirko's instruction/imagery cues is quite possibly as effective as tactile ones. Each class is different but you're guaranteed to be challenged and feeling energized. All this wrapped in both humor and encouragement (he's there doing all the exercises along with you!) is what keeps me going from start to finish.

I always remembered him because he was just such a great, funny, inspirational instructor who always kept the classes interesting and didn't make me fall asleep. Can't believe after all these years, I end up coincidentally bumping into this guy again last summer at Cafe Gratitude in Hollywood on his first day arrival in the states, where he now lives!! Although I don't teach Pilates anymore, I still try to practice it regularly because it keeps my core and back strong and mobile. Mirko transitions us from one movement to the next in a very fluid manner, challenging us while at the same time teaching modifications of the movements for students of various abilities and limitations.  He doesn't make us do a lot of mindless reps; instead, he focuses on executing the movements with proper form and intention so that you feel the burn after a moderate number of reps.  I look forward to taking more of his classes in the future... My back feels so much better after just one class! Thanks, Mirko!!",fh5LVvT1kIvew49ac-Cbow,Xiao Bao E.,91103

I took few different classes with different instructors and narrow it down to couple of them. Katrina is an absolute doll, she guided me through the class so I was very comfortable taking her class as a beginner. I also like taking Annie's class. I took her pilates and barr & sculpt, very hard for me the first time but I felt good afterwards. I wish they would have couple more Core Strap classes.

I love the results. I can feel I'm getting stronger and more compact. Yay! I'm almost 48 and compact is good! Also, my new found strength from the Super Slow technique improves my yoga practice (I can now do arm balances I couldn't do) and my overall well being  (feeling good in my clothes, better sleep, better brain)...Bla bla bla I could go on and on.  Sorry, there is a lot to love about it. You also deepen your relationship with your own body, you tap into strength you didn't know you had which is a really cool feeling if you are someone who likes to grow and expand and improve. And the beauty is 20-30 minutes one time a week. Melinda is the key player in how all of this goes down. I would only want someone guiding me and watching my alignment who is a pro - thank you Melinda. She is on your shit - in the best way! She is steady and encouraging.

Yes working out can be fun. The gym community is welcoming too, its a laid back culture that encourages you to do your best to be your best. The vibe is uplighting and lots of good energy. Classes run about an hour with a stretch, warmup and stretch cool down. The workouts change daily and work off a 5 day split making sure to hit every body part M-F which I love because you always know what muscle group you will be hitting. Erin is also super helpful and willing to help achieve your fitness goals, with check-ins and nutrition coaching.

I went in to visit Erin and I left crying with how kind and compassionate and interested she was in helping me with my health goals. Her and her entire family are so amazing at making you feel great and pushing you to your limits! Her sister, Tiffany, is such an amazing trainer there. Every day I would leave feeling like I accomplished something new and within less than 2 months I had seen myself lose over 15 pounds, and do things that I thought I would never be able to do, like plank! They helped me with a meal plan and taught me how to eat correctly. I can't say how thankful I am for meeting that family and being able to go to their gym. Did I mention you can bring your kids????

Both myself and my husband had little to no experience with dancing, but that wasn't an issue at all. Having a choreographed first dance took away a lot of the nerves and pressure of performing in front of people and made everything go smoothly. It was so much more memorable to have a lovely routine that we could capture on video and keep forever, rather than just swaying back and forth on the dance floor like most people do. I cannot recommend Amy enough!! In about a month's time she took two non-dancers and helped us with a beautiful routine that was genuinely impressive and touching to all of our guests. She is patient, kind, an excellent teacher, flexible in scheduling, and will know exactly what steps to do once she listens to your song. She's even good with song recommendations!!

I've worked with other trainers in the past and Justin is NOT like your typical 24hrs/LA Fitness trainer - not to say they're all bad, but most of them are hence the rep. There's a lot of trainers out there who don't know what they're doing and it almost looks like they're just getting their exercise materials from some magazine. Justin's training is different in that he's very much a stickler for form, function and technique. He makes sure you're doing the movement correctly, have the right form and posture and that what you're doing is functional movement that applies to your everyday life. He's not the kind of trainer that just slaps you on the machines and adjusts the weights and watches you crank out reps or the kind that has you doing some routine out of men's health/shape but doesn't do anything for you because you're not even doing it right to begin with. He helps correct years of bad habit, poor posture and body movement so that you can make lifestyle changes and adjustment and will explain how each exercise you're doing works and the benefits of it.

I understand the policy, I personally think (for those who are new to the studio, who may have missed the memo of this ""strict"" policy) they could've been more forgiving or offered other options (as does Bar Method for its students)- but ok, that's not my main concern.

At the time Paul was the sole trainer, and he was in the process of expanding the size of the gym and adding even more equipment. Prior to meeting Paul, I had only been (awkwardly) under a barbell once. I really wanted to just get strong and healthy, I actually wasn't even thinking about appearance much. I don't like the typical chaotic and busy gym environment, and to be honest I feel intimidated being in the free weights section. Above all, I wanted to make sure I was doing things right. It seemed pointless to start lifting and be doing things incorrectly or dangerously. I read about Starting Strength and searched to see if there was an SS gym near me, and saw a post on Reddit recommending Horn Strength, so I emailed Paul.

He is highly trained in kettle bells and in various martial arts. The classes are fun and flow quickly. Anton is adept in demonstrating exercises and correcting our form to prevent injury, all with good humor and a smile. I love how he incorporates our classes with qigong breathing exercises and various equipment, like Indian club bells and training sticks, to strengthen and promote balance, in addition to learning the basics of kettle bell lifting. All the movements feel organic and natural and are beneficial because they are rehabilitative and restorative.

Even then, he was extremely knowledgeable about the intricacies of kettlebell workouts, which are far more technical than most modern-day gym trainers would care to admit- mostly because they aren't RKC certified like he is. I recently reconnected with Anton, who has a world of experience under his belt. He recently got his brown belt in BJJ, which is quite an accomplishment, in and of itself. But the real novelty in training with him is his intrinsic knowledge of funtional workouts related to kettlebells. I can assure you that he's one of only a few remaining RKC guys left in the country.

As someone who struggled for years with the start and stop nature of fitness, working with Alvin has finally gotten me to the point where working out isn't just something I do in short bursts, it's a part of my lifestyle.  Going to the gym used to be a chore and now I get restless if too many days go by without a session.  Presto goes out of his way to make each workout different and fun, even when he's kicking your ass. Most importantly, as a guy in my mid-40s, he's been great about understanding where my weaknesses are and focusing on making them stronger. For the first time in my life I'm on the path towards having the physique and healthy lifestyle I've always wanted. Cannot recommend him highly enough.",FNkzphclAkdpiaZDcB3Ygw,John G.,91607

Recently, I was dealing with a lot of shoulder/neck pain and knew I needed to go see him after having a few expensive massages that did absolutely nothing for me. Presto was able to figure out what was going on with me, recommend some lifestyle changes to help me and again worked out all my tightness and 2 days later I feel AMAZING.

He really understands how to strengthen and shape ones body. Originally when I started I wanted to focus on strength training due to some wrist and shoulder issues. He spent months working with me on my imbalances and core. We are finally seeing results. Ive shed alot of body fat and now will focus more on toning and shaping!

I've been training with Presto since January 2018, but before Presto I had previous trainers. Here's where the ""theres is no one like Presto"" explanations come...we all are accustomed to knowing what we walk into when we train with someone on regular basis, but with Presto it was always a questionable state which made me worrisome in the beginning. But in a good way! Walking into every session was always a test of strength and full physical capacity. I have had previous injuries in the past but after recovery, I was left with the fear of pushing myself. Presto raised a high level of trust and taught me to push myself to levels I didn't think I was capable of. I will be forever grateful for that! He's not like any trainer that will put you through the same routine you are accustomed to. He wants his clients to accomplish the goals they set for themselves. The work he puts into helping his clients, reflects the amount of passion he has for health and fitness.",HKhGupkR0tN8LLumPbZsDQ,Vanessa F.,91607

Even though I have always been insecure about my weight and body, I always made excuses not to start taking my health seriously. Even when I was at my heaviest in college, I didn't think to change my lifestyle. In the past six years, I've changed my diet by cutting out meat and alcohol, and decreasing my sugar intake which have definitely helped slow down the speed at which I was gaining weight, but I wasn't losing weight and I still wasn't satisfied with my body. I did the 21-Day Fix DVD's at home, but even then, I was half-assing my fitness routine. It was incredibly frustrating having to watch the same routine every week on my 13"" laptop, which would often skip sets and make me lose momentum.",nHoUqTZmrIMBWG7dgsm2oA,Sabrina L.,90405

Sarah and Daniel are great fitness instructors. They have modified workouts for the newbies as well as advanced for those who want to challenge themselves.They also stress nutrition and create meal plans and send recipes. You also get motivated emails sent to you daily. They watch vigilantly and this helps to ensure you are performing the exercise correctly as well as prevent injuries. They have challenges to keep you motivated. I participated in a 6 wk boot camp challenge. I definitely felt my body looked better and I felt stronger. It's also a community environment, I feel like everyone is working toward their individual goals not competing and I really liked that. Now for the cons, parking. There is a very small parking lot it's usually full and very difficult to get in and out. Metered and street parking are available however most of the street parking a permit is required. There is only one area for changing, one bathroom. And every time I used it the toilet was leaking. No showers. No water for free or for purchase. Finally when I inquired about the pricing for membership, I was asked to come in. The price should be public on a website. It makes me feel maybe everyone isn't getting the same price. Speaking of price 197 for unlimited access. 187 if you commit to contract. There was no step down offered. I don't want unlimited access as I enjoy yoga, hiking, biking, cardio so it would have been nice if there was package for 2-3 days weekly. I also thought the pricing was a bit steep for no amenities. They do have an app where you can sign up for classes but it was buggy and required reinstallation a lot. Obviously this is a place with a few growing pains. I won't be back but drop in and check it out, it may be for you!",-Bad5SBE-CeLQ_Jr4qEHVw,Janayia R.,90405

Air conditioned? Yaaaaas! I came here on a one month unlimited voucher and I'm so glad I did. They offer two kind of classes: the mashup and endurance Pilates. The mashup was definitely my favorite bc it's 30 minutes of HIIT on the treadmill followed by 25 minutes on the reformer. Cardio is my jam so I really really enjoyed the mashup. Endurance Pilates is 55 minutes straight on the reformer. Both classes are tough and will leave you sweating n sore the next day.

Anthony planned my workouts both during our training sessions and outside of our scheduled sessions, sending me instructional videos when I needed help, and followed up regularly to make sure I'm still on track to reach my goals. When I rather severely injured my shoulder, he guided me through my workouts so that I could still make progress while allowing my shoulder to recover. I have had a few personal trainers over the course of the past 5 years, and Anthony is by far the most knowledgeable and caring one that I've met to date.

I was a bit nervous going into it considering yoga and pilates are my workout of choice. Since cardio isn't a part of my typical exercise routine, I thought surely I would die. While the class is very challenging and high energy, it is absolutely possible! I felt so empowered after having completed a class. I didn't realize my body was capable of doing more than what I expected. And the workouts are quick. You're in and out within 35-45 minutes, yet your body feels like you've been working out all day. I got more satisfaction out of those 35 minutes than I have ever had in a typical one-hour group fitness class at the gym. ",fQz_GbhtI3cwKM6TObj-lg,Kimi W.,91208

I took the completeCORE class with Jake and loved it! The class is really intense and hard I was sore for days! Jake is really high energy and makes you want to push yourself.

I wanted to find a new and more innovative group to go to, so I did some research and found MOTI. I am so happy that I did. It changed my life. Working with Dr. Ann DeGrey has saved me from chronic lower back pain. She is super patient and really listens to my needs. Their hands-on treatments and exercise programs allowed me to get back to my normal routine in just a few weeks. Now, I go on a weekly basis to maintain my health and learn new ways to tone and heal my body. When the pandemic hit and I had to stay at home, their telehealth program was very helpful. I wasn't really sure how the program would work, but it's been really easy to follow and maintain. Dr. Ann not only modified my exercises so that I could use whatever I had at home to keep up with my routine, but she was super flexible with her time.

Their instructors are fantastic (Courtney is my favorite). They used to be in the best location in El Segundo in a quiet area with plenty of parking. Now they've moved to a location in Culver City that has virtually no parking, so I hadn't been going as frequently since the past few times after their move I really struggled with finding parking. Their new studio isn't quite as large as their old ones so they've scaled down the available spots in the classpass app which is understandable and the best decision so that students in different classes aren't on top of each other. In terms of aerial fitness class criteria and quality, you can't beat them. They offer so many disciplines of aerial and for varying levels, and try to put in effort to ensure the beginner classes are truly beginner criteria so the newbies can actually learn. This place is a nice break away from traditional high impact fitness classes. Definitely worth checking out!",LOha3CKSDGOhNPP7d8Dkhw,Sarah K.,90230

I started here many years ago, and with the departure of some of the serious athletic trainers, I've had to move on. I understand it's a great place for some, but there are other studios that are a little more hard-core and encourage people to push themselves on the treadmill rather than avoid it.  When my knees hurt, I was instructed to walk uphill with weights as an option.

Me starting here was a sign from the heavens that it was time to get my fat self up and start moving my body again. I was going to sign up for this gym at one point and put it on the back burner but they texted me for the 6-week challenge on a Thursday saying a challenge was starting on that Monday, well that Monday was my birthday. So if that wasn't a sign I don't know what was.  This may be one of the realist reviews you'll ever read. Before walking into this place I was HUGE, and yes I was the biggest one in the room (still am, but smaller now.) because of my weight. Everyone around me seemed to be athletes all of their lives and I thought they'd be all pretentious and scowling at my fatness, you know the things you think when you're the big person in the room, and you swear you can read the thoughts of everyone around you. Well, what I found was a great team of supportive coaches and motivating classmates who actually care about your well being.  They are all kind, gracious people all with our own separate goals and nobody makes you feel bad about where your starting point is. Mine was in the toilet, lol, I pushed myself a little too hard at first wanting to keep up because I was super hyped by all these Hollywood Bodied People, and in the process, I injured my right knee jumping rope and running. I blame that on my ego of wanting to go so hard when I wasn't prepped for it. Jumping rope was something I'd not done since I was in the 5th grade. When I brought it to my instructor's attention he immediately was on top of it and modified the workouts for me so I could do them without injury, and in that, I have not skipped a beat in my weight loss journey. If you need help ask for it. If you need a better understanding, ask for it. If you aren't sure about something, ask for it, these folks are here to help you, and I can honestly say they've helped me. Again I've been here just a little over 3 months now and from where I started and where I'm heading are night and day. So I highly recommend this gym for those of us who are afraid to get started on changing your weight loss lives and don't know the approaches to getting started. Classes are different every day you never do the same thing twice, and because of that the pounds just peel away with muscle confusion. To date, I've already lost 25lbs. and that's under 3 months, and I couldn't have done it without the support of this gym. Though I am pretty quiet in class everyone there probably has no clue how much they've inspired me to keep going. So with that said I am showing you a picture below of my before and after, the before is a picture I literally took the first week I started, and the after is after my working out there for 3 months. To be clear I started with the 6-week challenge so I was only working out 3 days a week, but when that 6 weeks ended I started working out 5 days a week. Oh, and I will not lie to you I pigged out for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years, BUT because Id started to tone some of my body the Holiday bulge didn't hit me as hard this year as it normally does. What I can see is that there are clothes I wasn't able to wear for YEARS that I can wear now. Shirts that wouldn't button below the first button on my neck are now fully buttoning all the way down on me, and the buttons aren't screaming for help either, they are resting comfortably on my thinning frame. So I'm psyched to see what I'm able to achieve here at Peak 5 because if this is what I can see after only 3 months, I can't wait to see what I look like in a year. I hope this helps someone to make the move to join in with a wonderful group of people, who want to win, and want to see you win. I know this sounds cliche' but truthfully If I can do it, you can do it, I just didn't want to do it, and forced myself to do it. Was it easy? NOPE. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY, and there's no going back from it now, it feels too good, to be getting better. So welcome to the new decade folks we're officially in the 2020s so let's get healthy.  This message was brought to you by a former fat guy who has found his wings to take flight.",RhUOx0WUzPU_3UnmQ0ODgQ,James W.,90029

I've enjoyed the coaches and have no complaints. There really is no point in getting healthier, for whatever reason, if you're not going to change the unhealthy aspects of your current nutrition habits.  After seeing what it takes to burn off calories and the challenging workouts, I eliminated most sugar/carbs and began running - none of it was easy in the beginning - baby steps. I saw immediate results.  Go at your own pace, I still have to push myself to go to class but always leave feeling invigorated and glad I went.  Especially when you start seeing the results (I fit back in these pants - yes!). In the beginning your body is going to be in so much pain but it's only for about a month until your body acclimates to the workouts - get rest. *Soak in epson salt baths and whatever menthol creams you may need for your knees and other parts of your body that need oil (tin man). What I absolutely noticed was when taking morning classes, I would go to work and a surge of good energy remained for most of the day - I then realized it's body chemicals:dopamine, endorphins,seratonin - I was on a feel good high and you will get addicted - let me take my ass back to Crossfit (once the stress of real life takes effect)!

Just had my 90 day check in and I've maintained the same weight yet converted 6 lbs of fat to 6 lbs of muscle and it definitely shows. The first month was very challenging but I've been able to lock in a solid 3 days a week routine and I plan on increasing that number. All areas of my body including legs, arms, shoulders and core have improved very well. In addition, my troublesome lower back pain is completely gone which is of course absolutely amazing!

This gym is great- UNTIL you try to cancel your membership, or in my case, put it on hold for medical reasons.  Called in Oct. 2018 to put my account on hold for two months because of my high risk pregnancy. I was told it was fine and to call back when I wanted to reinstate it. I then start getting letters from collection agencies because I ""didn't pay"" my fees.  I called them, spoke to Dee, only to find out there were no ""notes"" of my call in Oct placing my account on hold. She said she was going to speak to the owner and call me back. A month goes by- no phone call from Sam or Dee. I called again to follow up and spoke to Joanna and let her know my situation. She takes down my info and calls me back (thank you Joanna!) with info saying she spoke to Sam and waived the two months the collection agency is billing me and was going to call the credit bureau to retract the negative mark on my credit score, BUT I was still on the hook for the two months my account was on hold because it ""extended my contract."" So if it extended my contract two months from October, it should have been up in Dec/January. I said, no problem! I'll pay an extra two months. It is now April and I got charged again and my credit report is still showing the negative mark. Called today and spoke to Valeria who said there were no notes about any of the above info :(  and my contract was now up in June because I started a new contract in October!

Coach Matt is an excellent teacher.  His classes are very hard, and they push you to your limits, but with every class you get better and better.  You will sweat every time without fail.  You learn something new every class.  What I like about this school is that they really drill and perfect your basics before doing jumping/aerial stuff. My other school, we had to learn tornado kicks and aerial cartwheels the first day.  This could be cool at first, but without proper form, conditioning, and basics, you run the risk of injury.  For the short time I've been there, I've lost some body fat, increased my flexibility, and strength.  I also like that the school is surrounded by positive and supportive people, so you don't have to worry about people making you feel silly.  I've been a big fan of Coach Eric's films and I heard about this school years ago, and my only regret is not signing up sooner.  Better late than never.  For those of you that are looking for an amazing school with excellent top of the line coaches, contact Coach Matt today and get yourself started to new healthy life.",rSwiA7uSKAcsvrlantfStQ,Aimee T.,90012

"I have had a lifelong passion for the art of physical movement and bringing wellness to others. I have also been a professional dancer, yoga teacher, Occupational Therapist, and massage therapist.

Neck injuries as a dancer and a shoulder injury from a car accident led me to discover the rehabilitative magic of Pilates. Through Pilates exercises (and physical therapy), I now feel stronger than ever. I have reclaimed my “dancer body” 20 years after my dance career ended!
In my Pilates training, I studied the classical repertoire of mat, reformer, Cadillac and Wunda chair exercises, plus contemporary exercises.

With 13 years of experience as an Occupational Therapist in rehabilitation, plus the combined healing powers of yoga and pilates, I have the unique ability to guide you back to physical health and help you transform your body safely! My methods are gentle but strong. Pilates exercises are low impact and therefore safer than other forms of exercise when given mindfully by a skilled practitioner.

Allow me to bring physical happiness back in your life!

Before Platefit, I had tried hot yoga, cycling, Barry's, Bar Method, basically everything that should have worked but didn't. I was hormonally imbalanced, majorly stressed, and was getting frustrated that I was tired, not losing weight, and not feeling well. My diet was consistently healthy too (I have been doing the Bulletproof ""diet"" for the past two years). Then Platefit opened and I lost 10 pounds in the first month. The vibrations are weirdly, amazingly healing. I really believed they helped cure the root of what was causing my issues. Apart from the weight loss, I have gotten my period back, my digestive issues are constantly improving, I have no more brain fog, and finally have mental clarity and energy.

I love coming here, the people are very nice but know that this is not a place where you come and just kind of workout everyone here WANTS to workout so that motivates me. Coaches are great... David's classes are fast, and he explains everything well and will help your form in a tough way. Coach Eric makes sure every move you do is the right move so classes are slower but killers. My personal favorite is Coach Mel she is kind, dedicated and you will die. I haven't attended to coach Belinda's class yet but I'm sure she will also kill you for 1 hour.

I didn't care where, but many of the reviews I read for RA Physical Therapy seemed like they might be able to address my problem and it was close by so they fit the bill. It was a Saturday afternoon, so I figured I would just call and leave a message, but much to my surprise, Rahim answered the phone and after a few minutes of speaking he invited me to come by, he was there doing paperwork, so he could check me out. I was classic  ""textbook"" case of a bulging or herniated disc in my low back. I could barely walk, it hurt to sit, and nothing I was doing was helping. Turns out everything I was doing was only making matters worse and as soon as I followed Rahim's recommendations and gentle exercises, I was 75-80% better within 3-4 weeks. Over the years, I've continued to see various other therapists here for regular maintenance and flare-ups that have happened due to neglecting myself, stress etc and they are all just so great. Cindy has addressed my chronic low back irritation and gotten me nearly pain free, she has a magic touch, Lenise has my overall body strength up immensely with her excellent Pilates training (which has also helped with my mind and mood) and all the assistants are great too. Special shout outs to Ivan, Veronica, John and Daniel! Ray is the only one I have yet to be one on one with but he has devoted patients as well. It is a top notch clinic and I recommend first thing before even thinking about a back surgery that you try this place out. I wish I was 100% pain free, but if I were then I wouldn't get to come do my regular workouts with all these fine folks and that would be a huge bummer!",MsqV5D0AXjEKmT0-HT0fkg,Sarah B.,90035

Tons and tons of bouldering area with lots of problem. I love the V-Scale rating system and im glad they use it here. Lots of problem for the beginner to intermediate range. Once you get up to the V9 level the problems are kinda sparse from what I've seen. Restrooms and lockers are on the second floor. They appear clean and well kept. There is also another second floor area which appears to only be access by climbing, which I think it super cool. Practically all the problems here are top out which is super cool and something I wish more gyms could try and incorporate. There is a good mix of grades to the walls here which offer a lot of climbing options and styles.

The Griffith Park Team meets on Saturdays from 7:30-9:30am. This is primarily a running/hiking and yoga team but we also dabble in triathlon training. We train for 5K, 10K, and Half Marathon events.

The Valley Team meets on Saturdays from 7:30am to 9:30am in locations throughout Encino, Calabasas, and Woodland Hills. This is primarily a run/hike team but includes triathlon and cross training.

Silverlake offers weekday workouts from 8:30-9:30am on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Classes focus on strength training, cardio, and flexibility.

We train by ""seasons"" and usually set our goal on a culminating event like a 5K or half marathon but members can join any time. First class is free.

Keeps you going, corrects beautifully for anything you have going on and makes it fun! We have a small group with her two days a week in Silverlake and she kicks our asses and we love it -- how often can you say that?! It's never the same twice and she is very aware of our progress and pushing us further. Best of all, I and others have all agreed that is the only fitness group that we are actually sad not to make it to -- a perfect blend of kick-your-butt, outdoors, and a little old-fashioned girl gabbing! Even though my work schedule interferes more often than I like, I have seen a big improvement in my level over the last year-plus -- and Lucie has upped my game accordingly! Plus the price is great for such personal, professional attention -- even in a group setting, she is all about you. I probably shouldn't even tell you about it -- I suspect I will regret it. I wish I could join her Moms In Motion group in Griffith Park on Sat mornings, but I have too many other mom things going on right now -- although I keep hoping!",bEtq9Y2jMXEjwZ8FQi-BBw,Mebby M.,90027

It was a mix of yoga, cardio, and weights with loud up beat music! The room was also very warm so after class it was as though i jumped into a pool of my own sweat!

Going in I was not sure what to expect. I knew the class was split in half: half cycling and half yoga (30 minutes each). The girl in the front was extremely helpful. She walked me through the whole place and how it works. She even was kind enough to lent me cycling shoes hat click in, but she told me you don't have to have them, but it does help( They are $3 to rent). After getting situated our instructor Hector came in and we started the cycling class. WOW!! I'm hooked. Hector was so awesome in keeping us all engaged and pumped up. The adrenaline was rushing and everyone was super into it. The upbeat songs helped a lot as well. After 30 minutes of sweating our butts off we walked to the yoga studio where there were already yoga mats on the floor waiting for us (usually they are $2 to rent). Hector guided us through some intense moves and stretches. It was amazing!! After a kick ass cardio to stretch and feel grounded again was exactly what we needed. The whole class was a perfect balance of cardio and meditation. ",tcwNlctBhfriTlfR453FhQ,Shelia D.,91203

My first class was decidedly this location for a combination of cycling and yoga, two things I normally wish I could do more of and probably will. The team that was working while we were here last Friday were spectacular. The lady behind the counter (I'm so sad I never caught her name) was so gracious and welcoming; she helped us get started and let us try the rental cycle shoes (which are free for first-timers!!!) and she made sure we were good every step of the way, even making I had brought water. Our instructor (I believe here name was Olivia, but also I am an awful person and do not remember) was equally as caring and professional. Both these ladies asked me my name, making me feel like they cared about me as an individual. Olivia helped me on my bike by adjusting the seat height as well as the handle height. She also corrected my improper form without being mean. In fact, she kept using my name throughout the class to hype me up and check in on me which absolutely made me blush and feel the love from our class! Music choice and coaching were both expectedly solid. We then transitioned over to the yoga portion and of course I know nothing about yoga, so she of course often had her eye on me to make sure I was achieving correct form. So helpful and so kind, these classes helped me feel good physically and spiritually.",GBHgHiYLASLNUE-bELxp0w,Nathan N.,91203

Overall I had a great experience. My first class was Sync with Daisha, she was nice , welcoming and love her music. I never been to a class that does 30 mins cycling and 30 mins yoga. It's was challenging  in the beginning but I felt great and refreshed after. I definitely appreciate the wet towels and tea shots after yoga class. The rest of the class I did HIIT Ride with Alyssa and Sync+ with Hector. They are both amazing , motivating and I can't wait to try other classes.

As a classically trained ballerina, it's sometimes hard for me to get into non ballet movement; but Jasmine has all the choreography and energy I've been needing in my life! I've done a couple workshops as well, highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to dance!",XFCSg-XyTu87cMBcU4to2A,Hana B.,90026

This is great for me personally because whenever I would go into a gym by myself I would always get discouraged and leave after 20 minutes or get annoyed by all the machines being taken. At this gym that doesn't happen because there is a limit to how many people can be in each class so it never gets too crowded.

I first asked the front desk if i could go on a quick tour of the gym and she looked very confused. She finally switched me over to another lady named Ceila- she said that Ceila would give me the tour. We greeted then went to the large main room. I asked a lot of questions about the class descriptions, number of members and class sizes, and prive session. However, I was met with unenthusiastic one word answers. I did most of the talking and asking as she seemed to scan the room and say ""yep, this our biggest room"" . I was genuinely interested to get to know the gym better but it didnt seem that she was particularly helpful, enthusiastic, or informative. It seemed like a large space and I knew they were a pretty new location so I asked how many members are part of Hardcore Fitness. She seemed completely shocked that I would even ask that question and replied with ""oh no, I cant give you that information. That's confidential, you know?"" I thought it was rude and don't think she even knew why she said it herself. I would have brushed it off but i had previously asked about how big class sizes are (I dont love overcrowded classes).... and she responded with ""it all depends"". After it was clear that she had nothing else to say about the room.... I asked if we could see the boxing room. Again, no information given about classes or instructors.

From what I gather, all locations pack so many bikes in that when you're doing arms you collide with the person next to you. I was on the sidebar closest to the mirror and I had to hop over two bikes to get to mine -- that's how little space there is between bikes. It was soul survivor which I booked because I wanted an hour long workout. The class was a little under 45 min. There were two people on the podium which I didn't understand. One lady was silent but riding the whole time and the other one (Janet) was ""instructing"" and sometimes on the bike. The music was terrible. It was all a ""concert"" country and rock and one really slow song. They all were live versions I guess bc there was talking and clapping and cheering at the end of each song. No extra towels. They didn't focus on telling us when to take off or add resistance or how much to add or take off so it was a guessing game. The arms song was terrible and we were supposed to stop pedaling.

Multiple Trainers Available",7801 Melrose Ave Suite,4.5,"Gyms,Boxing,Trainers",Fortune Boxing Gym,44,1,Fairfax,1/25/2020,"I just had a really terrible first impression experience here. The gym still, in a lot of ways deserves a higher review. But I had a particularly awful experience near the end, if you keep reading, which explains the one-star. I came for a ClassPass class this morning less than an hour ago. I jogged there, because it was easier than driving. I worked till 2 a.m. at my restaurant job, so it was hard to get there early. I got there at exactly the 10 a.m. mark. The class started at 10. On Classpass there's an ""about"" the class bio portion. Every other boxing studio there mentions the charges for renting gloves, etc. They don't on their page, but, I liked the gym at first glance enough, and the energy of the owner that I figured I could get and keep wraps and maybe like it enough to come back, so I bought wraps and rented gloves and was told to go outside and that the class had started. No one told me who the instructor was or how to find them, which seemed okay, because I figured they would be outside. Maybe they were. Maybe they weren't. But no one proclaimed themself as an instructor, introduced themselves, or gave any direction of what to do. So, I just started following the people running. I realized very soon that I couldn't carry my stuff while running, but was told I shouldn't leave it just about everywhere I put it. The owner said I could put it by the ring, but said he wouldn't leave the gloves or wraps there. So I ran with them. But no one else was. There were no lockers, or directions for where to put anything. Two people running sort of laughed at me saying I didn't have to carry my stuff. I ran back in, quickly. After coming back to put my stuff down against advice, I came back to run. I saw one guy ahead of me. Then soon, no one. I asked a girl out in the alley if we were done or if I should keep going. She yelled keep going. I realized soon she was with the other boxing gym right beside Fortune, not the one I was at. This is very confusing and something to note. Anyway, the longer I ran by myself, the higher my anxiety rose. I came to this class knowing no one, to work out stress and anxiety. I came here to connect back to my body. I was sexually assaulted by my writing partner, who was like a dad figure to me 3 months ago. His wife, home, and dogs were a safe space for me. Since then, I've been really disassociated. But I've taken a few boxing classes since, and felt more connected to my body. I had a bad restaurant shift the night before where people were pretty awful in response to us being severely understaffed, and I made a credit card mistake which could cost me my job. Hey, that's the violence of capitalism, right? So I came to this class this morning with stupendously overwhelming anxiety as is, but was hoping this could be a healing, connective experience to help me forget, feel my power, and make new friends, which is why I got up after 6 hours of sleep to make the class. CUT TO: I come back in to the studio. I'm clearly confused, upset, and on the brink of tears. I tell the blonde girl at the front desk, Alex, that I don't know where my class is, who the instructor is, and wasn't told how many laps to run or where to put my stuff down. I told her that I had incredible anxiety, and started to cry. She cuts me off to tell me the class is in the gym, points to them, and says I can go in with a very unkind, condescending tone. I go to the bathroom to give myself a minute. I come back out and tell her that I just want my $5 and to get out of there. I intended on just leaving, having a good cry, and writing a Classpass review mentioning confusing stuff to to take note of. But that wasn't what happened. Alex raises her voice and becomes incredibly defensive, which was so confusing, as there were no issues I had mentioned that really involved her, until a few moments ago with the frustrating, but not business killing condescension. From there she escalates tensions when she tells me that I should just go to the class, & that I should've asked her where the class was. I told her that I did. (Keep in mind, all of this is happening as I am crying and had just moments ago expressed desperate confusion very clearly.) She more so yelled at me than told me that she was going to get the manager. And she continued to repeat that this shouldn't be such a big deal. She said that like 3 times. Psych/Hospitality 101: When someone has anxiety, the last thing you should ever tell them, as a decent human being, not just a business offering services, is that this really shouldn't be such a big deal. Either way, it's bad business and shows an inability to read people. In the very least, it is unconscious to the realities of the world around you. You've GOT TO check-in with ppl. Especially new ppl, with specifics and direction.",yA6tf91TFcArAr8wUc5uzg,Olivia T.,90046

I told him that if I liked the class I would pay for it and that I had already trained in the past for several years. He took this as a sign of disrespect towards Eddie bravo. The reason I'm checking out 10th planet is because I'm an Eddie bravo fan. As a customer I'd like to try a product before I buy it. Unfortunately these people have not been properly trained in sales or customer service. So I just decided to leave and take my business elsewhere.

I was skeptical at first but went because my friend swore by her. When I started I was very physically active but I had severe scoliosis - 6 vertebrae were both curved and twisted inward, leading to numerous muscle and skeletal problems and near constant pain. Within one session Sharisse identified my problem and noticed my muscle imbalance. By the next session, Sharisse had a plan to attack my scoliosis. She had me do extra reps on my weak side, stretching on my strong side, and had me get a massage every week to loosen up my muscle spasms. Within 3 months I could feel a huge difference. Within one year my scoliosis was completely, one hundred percent gone. My Doctor and my Chiropractor could not believe my new x-rays. Sharisse is incredibly knowledgable and focused on her clients ensuring that they maintain perfect form to reach their goals.
