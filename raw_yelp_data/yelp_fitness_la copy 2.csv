Jacques is incredibly knowledgeable and patient. The FUBAR workout is not easy but the trainers are very encouraging, as it takes time to see results.

I've tried many programs out there (Camp Gladiator, LA Fitness, etc.) and S&TF is the only thing that works. These guys know what they're doing! Whatever your fitness goal may be, these guys will help you meet them. I started S&TF to prepare for my wedding. I wanted to lose weight and tone and I did exactly that! Losing weight has always been a challenge for me but I was able to change my body composition with S&TF. I ended up looking 30 lbs lighter just in time for my wedding. I wouldn't have been able to do it without their fitness coaching + guidance. I have also drastically changed my diet due to these guys. I'm eating clean now and it's a lifestyle change/shift. I have no one but S&TF to thank for it. I highly recommend them. I did both the FUBAR Versa Climber (30 min. workout) and small group Strength & Conditioning class (40 min. workout) with them. Extremely time-efficient workouts. Because of S&TF, I can't do an hour long workout anymore! Don't waste your time and money with any other program...really.

She was able to push me beyond my limits and help me become stronger. Every training session I had with her was unique and was custom to my needs. I learned new exercises and ways to tone my body that were actually fun and challenging. She challenged me to use certain machines in the gym that I would normally avoid. I was able to not only learn the correct form on the machines but also be comfortable to use them in my normal routine. If I was feeling pain in a certain area or sore she could easily adjust the exercises. I was able to lose 15 pounds in 2 months which was a great accomplishment for me. ,DfIRoXQhljUVy82MKBuD-Q,Erin S.,90025

I was never interested in the idea of signing up for a personal trainer, but I was referred to Toby and Hannah by a close friend, so I decided I would give it a chance. That was back in 2014. I've been so happy with my progress from training with the both of them that I am currently still training with them. I started with 2 classes/week to 3 class/week now.

I normally average 3 to 4 times a week when I'm in town. Given I travel a lot for business, keeping a healthy lifestyle, and a normal workout regimen is hard. Hannah is passionate about fitness and it shows through the energy and enthusiasm she brings to every session. She makes each workout challenging, and creative. She also places a high value on form on each exercise. Which I never had in my past trainers. She motivates me to push past my perceived limits to get results. I love the fact that she's not only a trainer, but she is also a certified  nutritionist. I don't have a problem working out as much as controlling my diet. With her help I now have incredible energy, my balance and flexibility has improved immensely. I also noticed my posture is getting better. If you are serious about changing your life to the better, or if you're on a plateau Hannah , and her business partner Toby can lead you every step of the way.

I've never really considered myself much of an athlete until now so needless to say it took me a while to get into the swing of things. As diet was a huge factor to what I was lacking Toby set me up with one of his top trainers/nutritionist Hannah. I've now been working out with Hannah for a few months now.  Started off with two days a week however we have now jumped it up to four times a week, as the results have been astonishing. As I live in the valley and they are located in West LA I see her twice a week in the gym for one on one workout and then she sends me programs twice a week that I do on my own. On top of that she sends me personalized meal plans every Sunday so I can prep for the week.

At first I just wanted to get in shape for summer and be bikini ready. I have always been slim but didn't have any muscle tone whatsoever. To be honest, I couldn't do a single real push-up or pull-up before I started. After about three months I could really start seeing changes in my body. Which needless to say I was super happy about. A few months into training, Toby started splitting his time with Hannah (Revolution Sport LA's Certified Nutritionist and Trainer) when it came to my sessions. She created personalized meal plans for me and that is really when my body transformation started to take off. She consistently monitored my progress and made me keep track of my food until I was able to really make the change into a healthy lifestyle rather than just a diet. I think the main thing to point out to people who are interested in Personal Training, Diets/Nutrition, and just making healthy lifestyle change altogether. It takes time! It doesn't happen over night and you really have to be dedicated. Its either you're in hundred percent and trust the process or you will be wasting your time altogether. You can't just eat or workout when you feel like it, unfortunately it doesn't work that way. It took me about six months to really buy into the program and to be honest, looking back I wasted those six months but when I did commit 100%, I'm telling you it was the best decision I ever made!

I worried that it would be hard to get the money back, that they would push you to buy expensive supplements, etc. I was also so scared about getting up at 5:30 in the morning to work out before work, when I've never been a morning person and am the type to always sleep in until the last minute. I was scared about being on a very strict diet for 6 weeks, especially over Thanksgiving. Well, it turns out some of my fears were warranted. It is not FREE. If you want your deposit back, you had better be ready to put in a LOT of hard work and commitment. Personally, I was ready for a big commitment and lifestyle change. I saw the amazing results my friend had just gotten when she completed her challenge, and I thought about how good she must have felt, and I was ready to feel that good too. I was sick and tired of working out for months and not seeing the results I wanted; of never quite being happy with my body or how my clothes were fitting or what I was seeing in the mirror and in pictures. I was also in the middle of studying for my licensing exam in my career field, and I knew that discipline, no alcohol, and exercise would help me be clear headed and focused on exam day. I decided to go for it, so I went and signed up. I'm honestly SO HAPPY I made that decision. This past Monday I completed the Hard Body Challenge and lost 6.4% body fat, about 9 pounds, and gained a better mood, more confidence, more energy, and I passed my exam! I have a spring in my step, and all the jeans I had bought and planned to wear when I lost weight, but had never actually been able to fit into, they now fit. The jeans I was wearing 6 weeks ago are falling off of me. I have muscles I've never seen before in my arms. I'm starting to see abs again. My quads and hamstrings are rock hard. Now that I'm able to have whatever I want to eat or drink again, I don't even really want those things anymore. I had my first drink in 8 weeks last night, and it wasn't that great. I had a churro the other day, and it made me kind of sick. I'm naturally eating smaller portions and craving healthier foods. I decided to stay on as a member because I love the workouts and the trainers and the supportive community. I've had better results doing this than anything else I've tried, so why wouldn't I want to continue?! I met my personal goals for where I wanted to be at the end of this challenge, and I still have a ways to go to reach my next goal, but I'm confident that continuing at the camp and sticking to a healthy diet will get me there. I definitely recommend this program for anyone who is SERIOUS about making changes in their life, health, and fitness. It is not for everyone. The journey was not easy, the diet is strict, and it takes a ton of willpower, sweat, cravings, sacrificing social life, and it's very time consuming (meal prepping, grocery shopping, doing the ""homework""weight lifting workouts, etc). They weren't pushy about the supplements, but they do strongly encourage them because your body really needs some of them. Personally I took glutamine, which helps your muscles recover and was a life saver (I bought mine on amazon), BCAA powder, which helps preserve muscle on a calorie deficit (also bought on amazon), a comparable protein powder to the one they used, fish oil, caffeine, and the MyoFX PM fat burners. Some people only use the camp stuff. It turned out ok for me with what I used. All in all, it was 100% worth it! Even if I hadn't met the body fat goal and hadn't gotten my money back, it still would have been worth it because of how much my body has changed and how good I feel, so try to think of it more as an investment in yourself, your health, and your happiness. Good luck!",lqDJRCQqSlWUYsGzPL_aYA,Amy G.,90026

They always made sure I gave it my all, and if I was slacking they where not quiet and quick to call me out on it (in a nice way of course). The diet part was so easy though sometimes I'd get bored. But I definitely learned how to meal prep and make boring food taste and look so good. With all that said I am proud to say that I am living proof that this works! I have dropped exactly 22lbs in 6 weeks and I am on to my second challenge. Don't ever let anyone tell you this program is too strict or that you'll gain it all back, because that's not true.

And this place left me with the worst first impression of ANY gym I've ever been a part of.  Let me first say that I've attended many boot camp style courses in and around LA over the last 7 years.  When I arrived the trainer barely gives me a hello before explaining that he is the trainer, the all knowing, all important being in the room, and I am just the fat pleeb who has no idea what I'm doing and if I don't like it then I can leave.  That was before I even asked what his name was and shook his hand. Never was I asked my background in fitness or how I found the place, like geez! So then he asked if I wanted to lose weight. When I replied no, he straight up looked me up and down and said that I should. I dismissed him and went to my corner in the room. The workout was hard, but his ""training"" style was a joke. Just ""go faster"". No real feedback or input, and whatever ""tips"" he had for the group were just insulting and not motivating at all.  I will also quickly mention, they did not answer the phone when I called them 6 times prior to class with questions, have the most disgusting bathrooms, no paper towels, no changing area, nothing. For $100/month at least stock some paper towels in the ladies bathroom. And for anyone that attempts to park in their awful tandem style parking lot - make sure you give yourself a minimum of 10-15 minutes just to park your car, and bring a lot of patience with it.  I learned online recently that this place is a scam and it really shows. It's the worst fitness facility that this city has to offer. I give it 6 months before it shuts down.",Z0PWnJVaCx6rH2ZngZcI6A,Christine S.,90026

While I believe the program can potentially work (otherwise why be interested) the way that they go about signing you up feels like a scam. They ask you for blanket rights to all your images. So basically you can end up in any of their marketing materials anywhere. When I asked for an option to sign something that would not allow that I was told it was that or the highway. The contract requires you to promote the company and it's really even worse than any multilevel marketing that's out there because of all the public activities they want you to take on their behalf. As someone who works in marketing and understands the power of social media I get what they're after but the fact that they do not give you a choice is definitely a bit slimy. I contacted the franchise owner to figure out a way to participate and their answer was to take my money and remove the financial incentive which is a big part of the psychology for people to complete the challenge. You want your deposit back as the reward. Thing is these guys don't really want to give it to you. They want you to advertise for them for free and most people won't get their deposit back.

After 33 years of being lazy I started working out last year, signup for the regular gym to barely see results and just feeling bored AF. My friend told me about this place and for some reason I procrastinated for months til I finally tried it. First class almost fainted but I was already hooked. First week my whole body felt tighter and now 2 months after I'm in the best shape I've ever been.

Cuz it is working! My coworker completed the challenge there and she told me about her experience, so i wanted to try it for myself. Plus I stayed at home for 6 months, without a job and gained a lot of weight eating crappy food. So on June 2nd I weighed in at The Camp Transformation Center and I was 209 lbs. I've never been that big in my life!I could not believe it and I was hopeless I thought I won't make it. It sounded impossible to lose 20lbs in 6 weeks. I was surprised that in my diet I could have such a thing like brown rice or sweet potatoes... Even oats... The first week I was excited, I worked out 5 days a week and never cheated, and I lost 9lbs, this really motivated me, I thought it was fast and easy, but after that i started to get tired of my meal preps and FTDI options. So I was eating pretty much same food everyday and my weight loss slowed down to 5lbs and then 3lbs a week... I never cheated. I got tired, but i did not give up, I kept moving towards my goal. The 20lbs challenge group on Facebook really helped me to find new recipes, healthy alternative...like protein pancakes, muffins and turkey burgers. It really helped me change the whole diet experience. In my last week I lost almost 8lbs, without carb cycling or tilapagaus. I couldn't believe that in the end of my journey I lost total of 30 lbs, without struggling or starving. And I am very excited for my second challenge! Cant wait to go back to the class, the workouts were always fun and productive, I dont think I sweat like this anywhere else. I am very glad I decided to join this challenge! I will definitely recommend this place!!!",C7odTjzvwZrWYeWH1laD6A,Tati R.,90026

I joined the camp back in 2015 in which I had completed my first 20 lbs challenge. I became a member for about year, and then came back last year (2017) to do 2 back to back alumni challenges (at a different location), which I also did well in. Anyways, fast forward to this year, I wanted another push to get me back into the groove of working out and eating healthier as I fell off during the holidays, so I decided to enroll at a different location for another alumni challenge, and I did it again. Unfortunately, this time around, it wasn't as fun. The vibes are different now. AFF as a whole is split into smaller families, and it seems that people who are just starting aren't getting the same inviting and welcoming experience I did when I first started. Now I understand that the goal of a business is to grow and expand, but not if it jeopardizes the rapport you have with your clientele.

At most I could sustain 3 weeks of that and then I'd fall off the wagon. My fb feed kept showing me a post about a 6 week challenge in Silverlake for weight loss, and i liked the idea of losing a certain amount of fat within a limited period of time, so I decided to go for it. I did the hardbody challenge where you're taksed to lose 5% body fat in 6 weeks. The experience was amazing and I loved all of the trainers! They're particularly mindful of watching over you as you pick up heavy weights to ensure correct form of the exercises. This was really great for me because my back slouches over a lot, and when I was coached to properly lift I could feel the burn where it was meant to be felt. Plus I saw that my muscle mass developed quicker after I had someone in my face telling me to go heavier, squat lower, and hold body resistance longer. It was nothing short of the best experience I've ever had a gym. Additionally, it was so much fun to workout with a group of people - big notable difference from my otherwise solo beachbody days. In the end I lost 5.2% body fat and 10 lbs in just 6 weeks. I've gotten lots of compliments walking down the street, but I gotta say fitting into an old pair of jeans without a muffin top is empowering! Lastly, an unexpected benefit of joining The Camp was the mental strength I've acquired throughout this process. I feel sharper and have improved memory recall.

First of all I highly highly recommend this camp and especially this location! This was only the second challenge for this camp since it is still fairly new. I think that the staff as well as the trainers are a great motivator because they were in our shoes before so they know how sore you're going to feel the first week. Every week they knew how to modify our workouts based on how on average everyone's weigh ins were coming in. Meaning if on average the challengers were not dropping a significant amount of weight as a whole they would incorporate more cardio into our workouts. Overall this plan of working out a minimum of 5 days check in before or after every workout, as well as having a strict meal plan works! You just have to stick through it and give it your all. What I really liked the most about this movement is that the trainers are constantly going around the room to help you improve your posture and they also show you modifications in case of an injury or you're not quite at a fitness level just yet.

Last year, I noticed that my clothes wouldn't fit me anymore and I was not happy with how I looked on the outside. I noticed that I was always tired and never had energy. I knew I had to make a lifestyle change. All of a sudden I see a Facebook ad about The Camp Transformation Center. I immediately felt like the universe was giving me a sign. I heard about it first from a friend, who has gone through and successfully completed the 6 week 20 pound challenge. I was very hesitant to even contact The Camp, I was scared of failing. A couple months go by, and it's January 2018. I told myself, ""This is my year and I'm changing myself to become a better me."" My fiancé and I went to the camp and it is one of the best decisions we have ever made! We immediately both signed up for the 6 week 20 pound challenge. The first week wasn't easy, as I was going through some abdominal pains. I ended up having to get surgery and Frances, the director, was so understanding and allowed us to rollover into the next challenge until I fully recovered. Once I was up and running again, we started our 6 week challenge. The first week was intense, I was sore all over, and we got up and still worked out. Meal plans are given, which makes it easy because you can only eat what is on the list, nothing else. The staff, members, and challengers all treat you like family and everyone is just so positive and helpful. The coaches even give modifications to exercises if you are not able to do a certain workout. I have just completed my 6 week challenge and I was able to lose 23 pounds!

Because of them I succeeded!!!  I have to say @ 42 years old I look and feel the best I have ever been,  not only on the outside,  but in the inside as well. Needless to say my challenge is not over.  I will continue my transformation journey by pushing myself to my limits and becoming the best that I could be.  If you're even thinking about losing weight and feel like it's not possible please go see the trainers @ The Camp LA.  They will do the same for you as they have done for me and many others.  They have a great success rate....I guarantee it!  All you have to do is take that first step and trust the process...then you're off to a better,  fit, and healthier you!  You will love what they will and can do for you!  Below is my transformation journey pictures.  I started at 202.6 and ended @ 158.8 lbs.  It's truly amazing what 12 weeks can do if you put hard work and dedication.  Thank you FB Peeps for following me on this journey.  I hope you will make a decision to start your own!",DwgunQKmX2AvMtFg8i688Q,Patricia B.,90007
,318 W 30th St,4.5,"Weight Loss,Centers,Boot Camps,Trainers",The Camp Transformation Center -  Los Angeles,201,5,Historic South Central,7/14/2017,"I completed my 6 week hard body challenge today. Initially I wanted to lose 20lbs but they told me the 5% hard body challenge would be better for me. I made it my personal goal to accomplish both. With hard work, fatigue days, FTDI, and tilapia I met those goals! From 228-207lbs, and from 22.9% body fat to 17.9% body fat. I lost inches on my arms  but I also drop from a 39.5 waist size to a 35 exactly. I'm very excited for my progress. These past 6 weeks were rough but I made it. From the dieting, cutting friends and fam off(temptation), forcing myself through the fatigue and tiredness to workout consistently. I've struggled many years trying to get in satisfactory shape. I can honestly say joining this camp was the best decision I made for my body yet. The set up of the camp was very convenient from the option of attending other locations to the many available class hours. Despite my personal feeling that the classes were more set for the 20lb challengers I still got  good workouts. However, I also made the effort to get my cardio in outside of the camp and get to the gym every day to lift heavy and tear muscles especially with all the protein I was consuming. From this challenge I learned how to eat, what's good for my body as well as what it takes to lose weight and be fit successfully. Like I said I spent many years in the gym on my own but it wasn't until now that I seen dramatic results. Whenever I had questions or concerns Chris Swoll Tc was always available to give me good advise along with support to keep at it strong!! I'm proud of my results, my supporters, trainers, and myself for this transformation. #Hardbody #accomplished #20lbsGone #6weeks #FTDI  Johnny Cerda George Thecamptc  Veronica Andrade TC",fT5dFD8cTSCwo0tJ6CFVnA,Andrew P.,90007

I was not just successful but also improved my way of eating and the amounts. I am so pleased with the camp staff that were always so helpful friendly and also gave us ideas on how to cook our food and even where to buy items. They even recommended previous challengers that would cook for us and made it so much easier. For people like me it's so convenient for us to be able to visit other locations in my case I went to Carson all the way to mid city depending to where I was working. The program is amazing always targeting many areas of your body helping us maximize our exercise and having them telling you what to do and how to do it right and modifications. I love the program because it works and because it educates me on eating better and in smaller portions.

It is hands down one of the best decisions I have made for myself. I am a middle school teacher. Teaching is emotionally and physically draining. I could feel my health deteriorating. I am only twenty-five and felt like a fifty year old.  I began trying to regain my health earlier this year. I began working out in my classroom before work but it was just not enough. A few of my sorority sisters did The Camp in the Inland Empire and had great results. The energy at the LA Camp is great.  I enjoyed classes with Raul, who is truly an inspirational trainer and a great motivator. I love George's music selection; He is the trainer that will whip you in shape. He is truly a pusher and has a great personality.  My sister and I successfully completed our first challenge and are now beginning our second challenge July 25th.  My father joined the movement and will begin his journey to health on the 25th as well.

,318 W 30th St,4.5,"Weight Loss,Centers,Boot Camps,Trainers",The Camp Transformation Center -  Los Angeles,201,5,Historic South Central,7/19/2017,In May I went in to The Camp in Los Angeles for an orientation not knowing much about how things really work there. What I knew was that there was a possibly to lose weight and have a body shape as the girl who's post I saw. I wanted to lose weight to get back to my old shape before my baby and just feel healthier. So I went to the orientation and decided to go for it. I decided to take the 5% body fat challenge. Many friends and family members disagree on my decision because for them I was already skinny but I wanted to go for it to prove myself that I could pass a challenge and simply get ride of my fat in the sides of my stomach. From the start the staff was and still is nice and helpful. Chris weighted me in and explain to me how the meal plan worked and answer any questions I had. The first week was the hardest. It was hard to get used to the meal plan and making sure I was following the directions. After the first week you will get the hang of it and will realize you need to meal prep. This camp taught me how to eat healthy and cook healthy which is something I was totally not use to before because I would always buy food. The workouts are great. I love how the camp works out as a team and pushes you as team. Every trainer gives good workouts but he aware of George lol. Chris teaches you great workouts that you could possibly do anywhere which is great because you do not always have to have equipment or be at the gym. Johnny is always full of great and happy energy. He will be the one that will tell you Good morning ! With a great smile once you walk in at 5am. Johnny workouts are great and push you to your limits you just need to not stop and keep going  because that's the only way you'll reach to your goals. With Johnny energy given in class helps because his not only watching you but doing it with you as well. Thank you Johnny for always replying to me with every little question I need to be answered I appreciate the support. George workouts are crazy but there are those crazy workouts that you know help you lose the more calories. George is the trainer who's class will have you died which is why I proudly say I was able to do 2 classes with him back to back every time he was there. You will get to love George because he dances the whole class while your working out and he is actually good and really gets into it lol which gives you more energy to keep going. Don't be scared of the crazy workouts be excited that you will walk out the camp knowing you work your ass of that day to your max and you will know that because of how much sweat you will be dipping. At the end when you hear George say ''and we are done !'' that is one the best feelings ever. Be scared if there ever is a class with George and Johnny together now that workout would be awesome to have. I hope it happens one day. Thank you to all the trainers and thank you to The Camp without you I would not be healthy. I am done with my challenge and proud of my results. I begin with 122 of weight and finish weighting 107. I lost a total of 7.2% body fat and bet that 5%. It's possible it really is and the camp does work you just need to follow the directions and not break them. You will learn how to watch everyone else eat in front of you everything you can not eat but it will only be hard in the start after you will get use to it and if it is really making you go crazy just smell the food lol it will make you feel better well it did to me as weird as it sounds.  Also push yourself I was doing 2 classes per day and was loving it with only one rest and day and night workouts in my house aside from the homework. Also carry with you your food that way there is no excuse on cheating. I will see you again Camp Los Angeles and very  soon to start another challenge.

I have officially completed my first 6 week challenge and lost a total of 25.5 pounds in 6 weeks! Before attending my very first camp session I focused a lot of my exercise on Cardio (Running) and a few HIIT classed a month.  I often found myself frustrated and upset because I would not see much results.  It wasn't until I officially signed up for the 6 week challenge that I began to understand the importance of balancing a healthy diet with an intense workout. By the end of the first week I was in complete shock of the amount I had lost by just changing my eating habits.  I fell in love with the workouts and the fact that there was never a dull day and no workout ever repeated.  Both the staff and trainers are amazing motivators, if they ever felt as though you could lift more, run faster, or squat lower they were sure to tell you.  The camp has given me so much of my confidence back, and have inspired me to continue my journey to a healthier more fit lifestyle. The staff, trainers, challengers and members at The Camp TC - Los Angeles have truly made this experience memorable. I am looking forward to my next challenge!! HARD BODY here I come!!!

I have just finished my first challenge and I am so excited to be able to do a 2nd challenge to reach my fitness goal.

Walking by that board is one of my favorite things. It's just the type of environment I need to make sure I care for my health. My boyfriend and I have tried to lose weight on our own but only found ourselves heavier than we started. This is no ordinary gym. This is my AWSOME FIT FAMILY. I am not the most social person and may not greet people when I see them. But when my boyfriend and I show up we are greeted by the trainers with a grin from ear to ear. I am appreciative of this program overall, and I am so blessed to have meet the trainers at the LA camp site. I don't see myself being with out the Transformation Camp LA.

I thought I would go and ask about the program. My friend had nothing but good things to say about the camp. I decided to do something to finally get ride of that 20 pounds that I had been unable to get rid of. The first day of my camp class I was impressed by the place. The area is large and clean and it is brightly lit with great music playing. The trainers are amazing is every way. I am not a very strong person, so I need many modifications all the time. The trainers point out modifications even before starting a work out so you don't have to ask. The trainers really care about you at this place. I remember one morning, I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep and was dragging. George the trainer asked me ""you OK Penny?"". That really was very nice of him. I find the camp to be a very positive energy place, that is why I love it so much. You have people who need to lose 20 or 80 pounds all working out together. Everyone is so supportive of everyone. You get to become very good friends with everyone. In my challenge I lost 22.2 pounds. It was extremely hard but I love my results. I am now a member and will continue to work on my health.

Tiger designed a particularized program to suit my level, one that challenged me without risk of injury. Before I knew it, I was able to complete three sets of ten pull-ups, which was a miracle for me given where I started. This gave me confidence and a sense of accomplishment that motivated me to be consistent in showing up and giving my utmost effort. Tiger also keeps the sessions interesting, fast-paced, and fun.

I have lost weight doing this but I have never felt that I really made a permanent change in my life. What was missing? A few months ago, I saw one of my friends who looked really good and even more importantly, looked very happy. I asked her what she was doing and she told me about this program--the 6 week/20lb challenge. I had my reservations and I did some research into this. Even then I was still not so sure. But I trusted my friend when she said that it really worked and it would be good for me. She was right!!! The most obvious benefit was that I lost over 25lbs in that six weeks. However, just as important (maybe even more) I think I have found a more lasting and healthy approach to exercise and eating. I found that missing piece. Not only did I learn a strategy that was clearly laid out so that if one followed it rigorously (this is the important part--you must follow it strictly), losing the 20lbs or more is achievable. I also, for the first time in my life, learned how to incorporate exercise and strength training into my life and make it stick. I have never been able to motivate myself to exercise and ultimately my body suffered because of it. But through this program, I got the support I needed through dedicated trainers that worked with me to encourage and support me and never made me feel inadequate. By the end of the challege, I felt a tremendous difference in my body, both in strength and energy. Finally, I want to thank the community of people both fellow challengers who were very much in a similar place like me and the staff who treated all of us more like a friend/family than clients. Specifically I'd like to thank #mastertrainerirma, #badassleslie, #taka, #bruno and #annette. For me, the last six weeks have been one of the most positive experiences of my life. It was not easy and you have to work at it, but there is clear path and if you can follow it, you will succeed just like me. Good luck to everyone who takes on this challenge. It can really make a difference in your life.",3p1CjNa6Fk1rd4yac45rCQ,A Y.,90034

And then my joints started hurting really badly and a rheumatologist diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. I could barely walk, I was in that much pain. I hurt everywhere! A bunch of the teachers at my son's elementary school, as well as a few of the moms, did the 20 pound/42 day or 8 week bikini challenge at FTA and they were all successful! I decided to give it a try although I never in a million years thought that I could lose 20 pounds in 40 days! Working out five days a week (or more sometimes) has changed my life for the better. I have followed the FTA meal plan in totality and, to be honest, I enjoyed the foods and I was never hungry. This is a very different kind of place. There are no fancy locker rooms are showers or a sauna. Those are not the things that change your life or lead to success.  At FTA, the focus in on a classroom with trainers, music and equipment. The trainers  are so amazing and totally encouraging - they really push you to meet your goal. In addition, you will meet wonderful and diverse group of individuals who are incredibly supportive and who I now call friends - we are all in this together! When I started six weeks ago, I felt like I was the least coordinated person on earth but I was encouraged and now I can do all of the exercises. In addition, every day the routine is different and the workout is inspiring. You are encouraged to push yourself as hard as you can. There are lots of high-fives! I never knew that was what I needed, but it works! I am not a morning person, but I look forward to my 6 AM workout or 7 AM workouts. I cannot thank  my trainers Leslie, Isabella, Magic Mike, Irma and Taka enough. They believed in me even when I thought that losing 20 pounds in 42 days was impossible and I surprised myself by losing 22.1 pounds!!!! I feel an incredible sense of accomplishment and will continue working out at FTA. I no longer have any pain, and when I went back to the rheumatologist last week, she did not find evidence of fibromyalgia!!!! The sense of accomplishment that I feel from completing this challenge has carried over into my personal and professional life. I now know that once you set your mind to something, you can achieve it. Thank you again FTA, you are the best!

I started feeling very tired and lethargic.  My workouts slowed and were less intense and my appetite increased.  At 42, I went to my annual check-up with my doctor and she told me about my weight gain.  I was shocked!! I was at 210 lbs!! For years, when I worked out, I WANTED and TRIED to gain weight, hoping to be about 190.  And here I was, chunky and out of shape at 210.  I needed to lose at least 20 lbs and get my old body back or risk more health problems.  I looked everywhere for workouts but none of them worked or understood my breathing issues.  I finally saw the FTA on Facebook.  Lose 20 lbs for FREE!!! Wow, perfect I thought, but what's the catch?!  I signed up anyway, needing a change.  After hearing Taka's pep talk at orientation I realized this was what I needed.  I'm a skeptic at hear but really needed this.  I jumped in and bought the supplements that day too.  The timing for the workouts was great...I could get work out before work!!  No excuses!  Often I would procrastinate during the day, telling myself I would exercise after work, but got tired and went straight home.  The trainers were great!  I don't like causing attention to myself but I told them about my lung issues.  They worked with me and adjusted the cardio workouts to meet my abilities (or lack thereof).  The food plan was excellent too.  I loved the guidance and plan.  The weight loss was slow at first, but after week #3, I really started noticing the difference in my clothes and most important, I had my energy and swagger back!  I completed the challenge and lost 22 lbs!  I feel great and will keep going!  Thank you for the kickstart FTA!!!",m261TLorJXzMCN_xaW5coA,Matt E.,90034

I love the environment and the people. Everyday has a new workout so it's not repetitive or boring. I  met a lot of new friends that I can call to meet up for hikes. I enjoy how we all push each other and encourage one another. The trainer I consistently workout with is Bruno, he is a great and motivating Coach  he knows when to push me and tells me ""blanca you can lift more than that"" and i love the encouragement. He is always happy and has a positive attitude every time i'm there. He is very intuitive, he listens to me and helps me without giving me attitude  Trainer Lauren is a sweet heart and very positive, happy, joyful, motivating, and an exciting person, she makes the workouts go by fast. She also encourages me to lift heavier or push harder. Trainer Strawberry  is very funny and joyful. I don't workout with trainer Elah very much but her presence radiates positivity and every time i see her she gives me a smile and a high-five. This place evokes wonderful camaraderie, team work and motivation which is exactly what I need after a long day at work. I recommend it to anyone looking for a positive fun environment.",KZWj54QK-_IJPAxpz-qBhg,Bb M.,90034

Someday, I hope to have abs like his.",LL05IphuBslrjajeuYsdrQ,Jesse H.,90019

The cellulite fit class was awesome too, much more of a relaxing class starting out with stretching and massaging areas of your body on the high tensity power plate.

To pre-face my rating is based on customer service alone and not the studio/workout itself. I saw this studio on Classpass and as with all new studios I Google search/Yelp them before signing up (especially if it's last minute).  I knew I was going to have very limited time to workout that evening so I decided to book a 30 minute Platefit class after reading their great reviews. I saw that they offered your first class free with a promo code if you sign up via their website so I decided to take advantage rather than book through Classpass directly. I figured if I really liked this place I would just use my CP membership to book future classes. After successfully registering on the website I tried to login to book a class with no luck. I kept receiving error after error, it was odd. So I called the studio to see if maybe they could sign me up but nobody answered; left a message. I then decided to e-mail them and received a quick response from Rachel the owner. Her response was cold, short and unapologetic something I would never expect from a business owner notably someone offering a new service to the neighborhood. I explained my issue clearly of not being able to login to register for my first class within my original e-mail and I was met with a response asking me what class I wanted to sign up for and if I had a package or asking if I wanted to buy one. At this point I was rolling my eyes at Rachel's indifference to the issue at hand. I guess she forwarded my e-mail to the IT people who handle their booking system and I was getting responses back and forth from several different people. Apparently the same issue had happened to other people as well that day. I guess this explains why Rachel was ""grumpy"", technology issues can really get the best of us. She finally responds that she signed me up for the class I wanted but still never apologized for the trouble, I thanked her graciously anyway. Now to review the studio, instructor and workout.... free parking is basically non-existent so plan accordingly. I live in the neighborhood but had to be somewhere right after class so I decided to drive down the block instead of walking as I normally would. I found a meter parking on Beverly and dashed across the street to get to the studio. The studio itself is small and clean, it has the usual boutique aesthetic feel to it. I was met with a stone cold face by Sarah the instructor for the 6:30 class. I walked in two minutes late at 6:32... give me a damn break, but I get it you want to maximize the whole half hour for teaching. Anyway,  a girl who was working their ""front desk"" which is really just a small desk in the corner with a Mac came over to ask my name to check me in. I didn't catch her name but she was nice and had the most pleasant demeanor of anyone I had encountered as of now at Platefit. The workout itself is challenging, Sarah is a good instructor and moves fast so be prepared to give it your all without really pausing for the whole class. I've done plate training before and didn't feel like I really worked out but you'll definitely be sweating at this place. So much so the nice receptionist brought over a towel to my machine. I would definitely try Sarah's class again and maybe next time I'll get there a few minutes before to see if she actually warms up to the people taking her class LOL. They don't have a changing/locker room but I didn't expect one as most boutique studios are small although they have a restroom stocked with the most lovely hygienic items. As I stated before I had to be somewhere right after so I went to towel off as best as I could and wash my face. They have Aesop hand soap, organic spray deodorant, lotion and gum for client's use. I thought this was great Kudos to Rachel on nicely stocking the restroom (hopefully people don't take advantage and ruin it for the future). All in all customer service was poor, workout and studio were great. I would give it a second chance just hate that I was left with a sour taste by the people who work here before even trying the workout. Hopefully next time its better!",PqpSGmGa_GXwGSeZCTdztQ,Anjelika C.,90048

The instructor set everyone up and woah what a unique sensation you get once the machine was turned on. My jaw felt like it was chattering. I couldn't help but laugh. 30 minutes fly by. At times it was hard to hear the instructor and people seemed to go rouge with the routine but they are pretty simple movements but with a twist because of the machine. Come try something new.

I opted for platefit because the classes are every half hour and because they had a Bootcamp and an ""Abs and Glutes"" class. There are other classes that I've tried and I've tried all the instructors and I can authoritatively say that everyone at Platefit is an absolute pro.  I really like the iPhone app i use on my phone to book the classes and the class size of 1-5 people is so small and intimate that personal attention is never an issue when needed.  Also I can do 1, 2 or 3 classes in a row and focus on what I need on the day to make sure I am using my time most efficiently. What's more Platefit is also near a great coffee shop for that after workout caffeine. Totally recommend trying Platefit because it's unlike any other workout and truly concentrates on your core and your muscles and tightens everything up in so much less time than any other workout available.  ",QhD0kYUrDGbEk_QWNO47SQ,Tracy H.,90048

Platefit is my favorite place to work out, hands down. It literally raises your vibration, and the workout is so much gentler on your body than any other workout I've ever tried in Los Angeles. I used to do ClassPass, but once I discovered Platefit I cancelled my ClassPass membership (which I loved by the way) and signed up for an unlimited Platefit membership. That was almost 2 years ago, and I've gone consistently ever since. All the instructors are so nice and encouraging; it is such a positive atmosphere to be in. NOT pretentious AT ALL! (Which was a huge sigh of relief for me.) I leave every class feeling uplifted and motivated. My body has transformed since I began and people even comment on it, asking me ""what my secret is."" I tell them it's no secret at all- it's this gem of a place called Platefit, and I always encourage them to try out a few classes. They have a 2-week unlimited special for newcomers so you can try a bunch of different classes to see what you like! (That's what I did in the beginning.) I'm so grateful to have found such an awesome place to work out, and I highly recommend it. I'd give it 10 stars if I could! ",k8a908RH0jW_fEH8OTPYDA,Frances I.,90048

I booked an orientation and after hearing what the program entailed i was immediately hooked.  I have a history of cancer on both sides of my family and my desire to pursue a permanent, healthier, lifestyle came when my cousin recently  battled breast cancer and beat it. So signing myself up for this challenge was a no-brainer.  I was excited and scared on my first day and all those uneasy feelings were put to ease when trainer Annette greeted me very warmly by my first name.  I was excited and felt welcomed.  Working out 3 times a week was good enough in my book but all of a sudden i found myself working out 6 days a week and actually enjoying it. Eating healthier was made easier when i was given a list and schedule to train myself on how to eat healthy. 8 weeks later im glad to say i sweated off 4.3% body fat and im no longer in the high risk zone health-wise.  I want to thank trainer Annette for her bad-assery she brings to each session, trainer Strawberry for her sense of humor, trainer Bruno for always accommodating workouts due to my pulled muscle, trainer Taka for making it fun on the darkside, trainer Aja for always having a smile on her face and master trainer Irma for giving me this opportunity to learn how to better myself.  I couldn't have learned all i did without the knowledge and support of the FTA family.

I started the 8 week challenge at Fit and Fun Fitness Transformation Academy because I knew I needed something to put a spark in my lifestyle and I knew the program worked after watching Becky Drake participate last fall. I expected it to be tough, I expected I'd have to confront my usual habits and I expected to resist the change. What I didn't expect was to fall in love with putting my health and my body first. I didn't expect the comradery and support I received. I didn't expect to come in excited to work out and see what new and different exercise we had for the day. After just day one, there was a kinship among the groups to hold each other up. The trainers, who are motivated and give 100% each day, had been where I was and knew what I was going through. That in itself gives the program a leg up. It was an open environment and I didn't feel judged. To come in each day and see my teammates work made me work harder. Next, I began to feel my body change and respond as I fueled it properly. I could see the changes within the first week and that egged me on. I learned what my body could do when I treated it right. It was thrilling to see real results. When the 8 week challenge wound down, I was sad to see it go but inspired to keep it up, now armed with the knowledge of what I needed to do and that I actually COULD work that hard. Not only was I proud to lose 15 pounds and 5.6% body fat, I was proud that I could work that hard and encourage others to do the same. The whole team from FTA supported me and cheered me on, not to mention my comrades Becky, Erica and Molly. The program is a commitment but one that can change your whole perspective on fitness and health. I'm thankful I did it and know the experience will stay with me.",bCY1TOdFOrdxRc1EUEJSLQ,Sarah S.,90034

When I started I weighed in at 235.5. At 20 years old, I was tired of looking at myself in the mirror and feeling miserable and slow. I'd play basketball and feel lethargic and slow. Than I watched my friend shed weight and wonder how'd he do it. At first I laughed it off like it was nothing but after a while you find yourself wanting a change. So once I got my money together, I decided to take the 6-week challenge. The FTA does an exceptional job at working around your financial situation and you can tell they truly care about you. Once listening to their advice and attending their gym for 6 weeks I dropped 26lbs and I feel better than I have ever felt.

Once you rationalize things and put things in perspective, I promise you will see results.

Follow the Damn Instructions.  That includes simple workout routines, mostly body weight exercises five days a week in a VERY welcoming environment where the trainers and members support and cheer each other on.  The minute you walk in you can't help but move to the amazing music they play for workouts.  FTA also provides fantastic guidance on nutrition, including a step by step meal plan and a shared community of information on meal prep, recipes and other good stuff.  You don't starve in this program.  You get to eat nutritious, wholesome meals that provide the energy needed to lose weight and gain lean muscle mass.  The main thing that separates FTA from the rest is the trainers.  Irma, Taka and Ellen obviously love what they do because it shows in the way they lead the workouts, encouraging us to get out of our heads and push our bodies beyond the limits we impose on ourselves.  Ellen is a living, breathing testament to FTDI.   She was once an FTA student who is now an amazing trainer that competes in swimsuit and fitness competitions.  I can't say enough about FTA.  It's the best gym I've ever been to.  I highly recommend FTA to anyone who is interested in getting fit and staying fit for life.",RjrSZzf2Y6MF9Dah86exOg,Mark E.,90034

I worked there for almost two years as a trainer and I'm grateful to have been a catalyst that helped change people's lives. I saw many people walk through the door usually skeptical and uneasy at first when they came for their first workout, but the one thing we emphasized at FTA was to have fun! Once people got more comfortable and opened up they were unstoppable. Yes the journey is hard, there are many obstacles you will face in your daily life that may set you back on your weight loss goal. There is no reason to fear though because everyone there at FTA wants to see you succeed. Some of my favorite moments were the weight outs in which there was almost never a dry eye because many people would complete their goal, those moments were priceless. I have gained a lot of  experience thanks to Irma and Taka who both taught me so much.

I hated the way I looked and I hated everything about my body. I was desperate to change it so I could feel good. The first few days of the challenge were terrible. I was so mean to myself and I prepped my food out of obligation and perfectionism. I said mean things to myself when I wasn't ""as strong as I should be"" and lost my breath during work outs. Now, there is still more to be done on my journey to self love and I have to say Fit and Fun Fitness Transformation Academy really helped me with that. While I don't agree with everything in the challenge, my testimony is for the loving and supportive community at FTA. I would have liked to know in advance that the ""supplements"" they require you to take during the challenge aren't actually supplements. They are diet pills. I did not want to take them and when I complained about my body not agreeing with the supplements (I was on a caffeine high and even threw up), they said I have to take them and not to worry my body will get used to them. If that's not a red flag for ""drug dependence"", I don't know what is. So I did not lose 20lbs and I'm sure I would have if I took these diet pills since I followed all the other instructions. My review would be 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for that. The community, the gym, the trainers, and the work outs are AMAZING. Your joyful spirits and unconditional support got me through.

Originally I gave this place 5 stars an a good review. The reason for this was not at all because I actually felt that way but because I had to. The owner Irma insisted we provide positive feedback on yelp as well as on all the Facebook pages in order to get our $500 investment back upon completion of the program. For the 8 week bikini challenge one is to get their money refunded contingent on the fact that they either lose 5% BF or have a significant difference in appearance. I had lost 6.4% BF by week 6 and even though it was visually noticeable that I had physically lost fat on my body (esp. around my waist) the machine showed that from week 6 to week 8 I had gone up in BF, ultimately only having lost 2% from the original, and not losing the 5%. I and a lot of the people were astonished because they saw the significant difference of body fat  just by looking at me compared to my appearance beforehand.  I had actually just gotten my period the day before our last weigh out and even a couple of the trainers that work their told me not to worry and that this natural ""issue"" that I have no control over was probably throwing off the BF% that was shown. I was told that they would go off of my before and after pictures in that case. Oh, and let me point out that I lost about 10 pounds from week 1 to week 8 as well. Even Irma herself stated to me that she would use the pictures to determine if the difference was significant. Well let's just say she must've thought the significance in improvement and BF decrease of my body must've been great for she put up my pictures as marketing for her business on the Facebook page. However, when I met with her she told me that the significance was not great and that for that reason she had to ""decline my refund"" . What a joke! Now you tell me if you see a difference!  Really? That's very contradictory. She is money hungry and that BS about you either losing 5% or having a significant difference doesn't mean anything if you don't actually lose the 5%. She will just simply say that it's not significant to her. I messaged her letting her know how unprofessional that was and that I should get my money back. She read it and ignored it...what does she care...she got my money. Obviously I made a significant improvement and those pictures of mine are going to bring her clients and money. She is money hungry and will do anything to keep your money...(maybe even rigging the machines).

I signed up for a 6 week challenge and started taking classes regularly 2 weeks before the challenge started. I had so much energy! The first week within the challenge I lost 6 pounds!! I am so thankful that I finally found classes, trainers and a gym that I enjoy. In the past I've spent thousands of dollars on diet plans, gyms and shakes. FTA makes it easy for me to stick to. I find myself looking forward to workout sessions and they make it so convenient by offering so many classes during the day. Like I said, FTA has changed my life. I highly recommend doing a challenge or becoming a gym member like myself :)",Pl8jDyZQ2JkcdTe5yikXIQ,Joanna P.,90034

He prescribed several drugs for different aliments. My blood pressure was very high, my body pain was continuous and my cholesterol level was elevated. I decided right then, I needed to do something about it. I was on Facebook and saw an ad from (TFA) Transformation Fitness Academy. I reached out to Coach Irma and joined their program. Now I'm telling my story. My life before the challenge was exercising every now and then. I would fuel my body with unhealthy foods and unhealthy sleeping habits. I was only as good as my body. I was desperate for a change. Now that I have completed the challenge in 6 weeks I'm committed to me first. I take better care of my spiritual & physical body.  I'm much stronger, wiser about my health and I can perform exercises I couldn't do when I began this journey. My blood pressure average is 110/70 and I lost 21.4 lbs. at TFA. I learned through this process that If I persevere I will win. I must plan or I will fail. Please find time for you body or sickness will find time for you. Its continuous and a permanent lifestyle change for me. At FTA Taka Rivard and Irma Sandoval coached me daily to success and swam laps with me. They worked at my pace and level. They were my biggest cheerleaders. FTA has a positive workout environment. I made new wholesome relationships that encouraged and supported me during this challenge. Taka and Irma have a successful plan that gives you desired results. You must follow the instructions!!! I'm grateful I had the pleasure to work with this dynamic duo team. If you truly want to change I recommend this program to my family, friends and unknown person. You will not be disappointed. Thank you Taka and Irma for investing in me all of your knowledge, time and expertise. I'm better because you did.",NYXMIdZnl933bJDCKqdILA,Diane T.,90034

Why do I workout? Through workout and discipline, I have learned to respect my body by making time to workout and feeding it the proper food at the proper timing in order to get into the best shape I possibly can. The workouts are designed to challenge you and make you stronger as you continue the program. I really enjoyed seeing the difference every week as I got stronger and could lift heavier weights. The beauty of this program is that you see results quickly. I became addicted to getting results. I did the Swole program recently and I got my body fat percentage to be lower than its ever been in my life. I felt so strong  after I finished it because not only did it tone my body, I also learned to safely lift weights. Irma and Taka really care for their students and go above and beyond to help. I can't imagine any other gym that has such a fun, engaging, and uplifting environment. If you follow the rules, you get results. Its as simple as that. I have gained so much self confidence, strength, and discipline through working out. It helps me deal with my everyday stress. I didn't expect to get all of that when I joined this gym. My weight loss journey at FTA has not only changed me physically, but it also has changed the way I deal with situations outside the gym.

In the beginning I was shocked at how weak and out of shape I felt. Little by little I got stronger and the routine became easier and easier, while the results slowly started to reveal themselves to me. It takes more than just saying you want to lose weight. It takes discipline, determination and wanting to be better. It was tough. It was brutal. It was wonderful. There were times when I was working out, feeling like I would die, and would look over to the person beside me who was struggling even more, and it made me realize that we were all in it together. The sense of community I felt was magical. The Fitness Transformation Academy has helped me get back to my core, my power and my strength. My final weigh out for the 8 week bikini challenge was this past weekend and I lost 20 pounds. This was days before my 50th birthday, so I was very happy, and a bit shocked to be honest. I am grateful to Irma and Taka for their inspirational motivation. There were days when I didn't want to get out of bed at 4:30am or even 6:30am, but the team dynamic that was created made it all worthwhile. This process of working out was absolutely transformational. I became addicted to the routine quite honestly. The amount of sweat that poured out of my body was comparable to that which I experienced in my youth as a competitive athlete. It felt incredible and the clarity and energy that I experienced was intoxicating. What revealed itself to me through this journey was my own integrity to myself and my health, and I am grateful for that to be realized from day one to the very last day of the journey. I am grateful and clear and stronger than ever before because today is the beginning of the rest of my life and it is through the discipline that I learned at FTA that I can move forward in my life, with the discipline to continually be better.

Drinking every night, gambling and enduring a toxic relationship took a toll on my weight. I was at my highest weight ever (240) and my self esteem flew out the window. For years i tried to figure out what had gone wrong in my life for me to be so dark. I decided, No more of the negativity and things that continuously made me unhappy! I had an awesome trainer who helped kick start my journey and i lost 15 lbs in 2.5 months :) i was able to keep the weight off and lose an additional 20 lbs on my own. Leading up to the discovery of Fitness Academy I was yet.. going through another tough relationship where i completely lost myself. I knew how to find my happiness again but i didn't know where to start! Here I am writing to you after have been in this training camp since end of July 2015 to now Nov 11th that I've Never Felt Better. I am finally under 200 lbs after 6 years of personal sabotaging. I am on the road to recovery feeling great and loving myself first for once (or again in a long time)!

My confidence and self esteem has boosted tremendously but still have a long way to go! It is necessary I share my story because if she could turn my life around...

Not so.  The number on the scale kept creeping up and one night at class with the #darkside, I was encouraged by supportive members, and trainers, who never give up on anyone, to step up and take the challenge.  ",rOrijssyTtjfF3pDNOTafg,Susan J.,90034

I did it and loss 24 lbs in 6 weeks. ""Wow"", you say! ""How did I do that"", you ask? Well it happened after a little prayer. I have done several weight loss programs and diets, which worked but I gained the weight back and a little more, for luck, I guess. I was frustrated with being overweight and too cute to be overweight so I knew that I needed something different and something that would push and motivate me so I prayed to God and asked my Lord for help. God answers prayers because all these sponsored pages about all these body transformations and losing 20 lbs in 6 weeks started appearing on my timeline. So one day out of boredom on Facebook and curiosity I explore a page  and visit their location in Downtown LA. The program appeared cool but it was too far for me and I won't want to deal with the freeway traffic just to workout. I want to lose weight but I had to be honest with myself and knew that it wouldn't work for me there. So I went back to God and prayed to my Lord again. He answered my prayer again, Yay, with the same program but at a closer location. Okay, Lord, let's go check it out. Secretly I liked it going in because I'm a superhero fan so after orientation I joined. Everyone was cool, friendly, and awesome. Shout outs to Annette Olson, Angela Mitzner, Rosa Leslie SixWk Coordinator, Taka Rivard, Irma Sandoval, and Bruno Pontes. Okay, two weeks in and the weight is coming off, yes! I can do this, no problem! Third week in... I lost a lot in inches but gained two pounds from my last weigh-in. I felt defeated and wanted to give up. God is awesome because he gave me some helpers along my weight loss journey, Angela, Annette, and especially Bruno. The next day after my weigh-in, Bruno spoke to me before class and really encouraged me. He lifted my spirits and gave me a different lookout for my weight loss journey. He helped me to celebrate my progress and enjoy the process. Through his talk it triggered a lifestyle change and not just a weight loss challenge. Now the weight that I lose, I won't gain back. I see food and exercise through new eyes and I'm encouraged to keep going so that my pictures are up next to Annette's. Thank you everyone at FTA for helping me through this new and even sexier me.

My body urges for a deep workout now.  My body rejects foods that aren't very nutritional for it. It's normalized. My mind told me to not get out of bed some mornings but my body made me do it.

I had been very active all of my life until I had my first son 10 years ago. Since then, I haven't been consistently working out...just walking ( no real sweat). I was on a very slippery slope in the wrong direction.  (Increased fat in my midsection and not feeling strong). That is when my friend Cindy suggested I join her for the 8 week bikini challenge. She was looking great so I thought I would give it a try. I wanted to build more muscle and lose fat at the same time. I wanted an efficient, effective and enjoyable program and found it at Fit and Fun Fitness Transformation Academy! I am currently down more than 5% body fat and feeling stronger. I never thought it would be possible to get these results as quickly as I did.  The environment at FTA (Irma, Strawberry, Annette, Aja and other challengers) is supportive and they really help to keep you on track to gaining and maintaining a more positive relationship with food, your body and self image. They have all been through it and are living, walking proof to keep us motivated.  I found the challenge to not only be efficient and effective, but I really enjoyed my time there.  That says a lot seeing as I got up at 4:15 every morning to make the 5am class...and truly enjoyed every class:)",JXXg2sldPvVoOCmx8PTwWg,Laurie W.,90034

So with the knowledge I had gained from the challenges, I figured I could continue losing weight on my own. While my enthusiasm was strong at first, after a few weeks my motivation was lost.

All of the trainers and fellow members are so positive and motivating.  They make you want to push harder every single day. With pushing harder comes results.  After every single work out I felt stronger and healthier than the previous. The results are what made me keep on coming back.

Irma and Taka not only have the winning combination, but the secret sauce to help you achieve your goals. They don't just take your money and hand you a weight. It starts with sitting down and getting to know you and why you are there, how can they help you; and this starts making your weight loss journey personal. Next you get the experience of a personal trainer but within the group sessions. No one works out alone and the varied circuit style classes has no more than 20/25 people, and keeps the body moving and changing without laborious reps on the same old machines. Their instruction is motivating and exactly what you need when you start dwindling or drifting. They are quick to correct form and technique and slow to educate you on how to understand your body. The music is pumping, the coaches are on your side and your team is encouraging. Nutrition will be 70% of your weight loss, so Irma's valuable experience and insider knowledge not only starts you on the right path, but helps you get back on track when you fall off or plateau.

I love that they warm up work you out and cool down. I have never done warm ups and cool downs before. The stretching for the cool down closes the session nicely. In the past at a regular gym I had a hard enough time walking throu the door let alone coming up with a routine that keeps me engaged like fitness transformation academy does. All i have to do is show up and they handle the rest for me. The Sing I like the most is the sense of community the people are very supportive other members we have all been through the same difficulties and we're not shy about supporting each other and cheering on everyone else's success. The reason why I looked for them in the first place was because I was having trouble controlling my blood pressure and since I started here I work out sometimes twice a day and that is saying a lot because before I came here I hated and I'm using the word hate exercise I had lower back pain three workouts and it was done no more back pain till today I still have no back pain because it work out my core and my back.,IvoK3gsvnG5tb09fc9hmAw,douglas a.,90034

I've tried the Atkins diet, Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, neighbor recommendations, old wives tales, exercise videos, gym memberships, and nothing worked. I couldn't comprehend why genetics were against me and why I was who I was. I was at an all time low, feeling depressed, unhappy with myself, and sad that I might pass this on to my child. My mind would constantly torment me with the idea that my father passed away before I graduated from high school; that I might not see my own child graduate due to my unhealthy weight and lifestyle. A face book friend of mine kept posting The Camp Transformation Center pictures. I will not lie at first I felt a bit annoyed with her daily posts and thought ""woopie your at the Camp again""; then I began to see her body transform in a couple of days. I started looking for reviews videos and anything I could find online about The Camp Transformation Center; until one day I finally called. I went to orientation and thought "" what am I getting myself into"" "" will this work or will I give up"". I took the 20lbs. Challenge in six weeks. And guess what everyday I found motivation to do my end of the bargain. I picked up my phone to check in on fb and found posts that motivate me to keep going.

Im so glad that I did!.. I was surprised as to how nice the staff was, totally approachable and empathetic to my concerns/ excuses lol.

There reviews on the camp experience was all great . After going through a lot this past year I decided I needed to do something. I went the camp orientation and decided to start... after I signed the contract and walked out of the camp I asked myself if I had just done the right thing ... I had just paid 497 dollars ooooo man !! Jan 9 my 6week program started. Let me tell how my mentality changed quick. I feel in love with the camp and the staff.! The work outs are not easy but with the motivation and the push the trainers give you , you get thought it... As I started to see my body changing and sliming down I couldn't believe it!!! This program works as long as you push though and follow the damn instructions you should be able to achieve losing the weight.  I ended up losing 25lbs in those 6 weeks and I feel amazing . I rolled over my money to another 6 weeks and I can't wait to see how far I can get .

,318 W 30th St,4.5,"Weight Loss,Centers,Boot Camps,Trainers",The Camp Transformation Center -  Los Angeles,201,4,Historic South Central,4/14/2017,"The Camp changed my life. I signed up for the 20 lb challenge, beat it, and got my money back. As simple as that. Some people said it's a cop out because you have to be a certain BMI in addition to losing the weight, but the BMI you need to reach is still in the overweight range so it's very realistic. Also, it's easier to lose the 20 lbs when you're extremely overweight, so it makes sense that they have this clause. The camp worked with my schedule and was accommodating when I went out of town for a week, so don't let that stop you from signing up. Just follow the diet plan and try hard during the workouts. I bought my own protein shakes since I hated the ones they sell (plus, they're expensive!). I used Pure Protein from costco and had no issues. I only used the fat burner AM and glutamine supplements. I probably could have done without the glutamine. Yes you are required to give a review to get your money back but they tell you to give an honest review. They add you to a facebook group for support (which is somewhat helpful and at times can be annoying/frustrating) and give you a ""bible"" that includes the diet plan and workout tips. I would have definitely become a member if I stayed in the LA area longer, but they do not have a Camp in the area I'm moving to. I love that it is a judgement free zone. Although I was one of the more fit people in the gym, I always felt challenged and engaged. They have modifications of every exercise for all fitness levels and if you have injuries. So great!

The diet was okay with me because i had reach a point in my life were I used to eat so much outside that the food wasn't tasty anymore. It was hard to eat every 2.5 to 3hrs every day because i was used to eat only twice a day (junk food). I'm was not a breakfast person, I usually would only have my coffee and sometimes a donut or a piece of bread so it was a bit hard at the beginning but now it's a habit. The first week was exhausting because I was super sore after my first 5 check ins and then in the 2nd and third week I couldn't take the pain on my knees so I started using knee braces for the rest of the challenge. Although I stayed FTDI 100% I wasn't loosing a lot of weight in the first weeks. By week 4 I started to do a little extra cardio and it did help me. When I weighted in on the 5th week I had already lost 12.6lbs but I knew I had to do the emergency diet. The last week was the hardest because the workouts got more intense and also because I was doing Tilapigus but at the end of the day, my hard work paid off and I lost exactly 20lbs.  I'm beyond happy for my results and I know I wouldn't had lost those pounds by myself. I'm super thankful with George and all the staff and trainers. They push you to your limits and make you get out of your comfort zone.

It was an ad that based up probably based on my location. I was instantly drawn to the ""FREE 6 Week 20lbs"" program. I've been working on my weight goals for the last year and have been successful, however I felt in the last few months that I was starting to revert back a bit and needed a program with some structure to continue my reaching my goals. After doing some research I signed up on a leap of faith and then messaged my friend to join. Before I could officially join I had to visit the camp for an orientation. This is where I learned that what I had read was simply advertising- for a fee of $497 I could join, then and only then that I lost weight (not 20lbs, but rather a number based on your height) could I request my money back. Of course being the skeptic I am I asked A LOT of questions. I hadn't walked in expecting to part ways with $500 and was feeling duped. Why just tell me from jump the truth? But of course that's not good marketing. And I probably would have been less likely to jump on the band wagon so fast. As upset as I first was, I realized in that hour that it was hard to be mad. I mean think about it: for 500 i get to lose weight that i've been carrying with me for most of my life, and can end up getting the money back. I had done a weight loss program before which cost me $2000 (worth it but if we're talking bang for my buck there's a clear winner here). ",AinPxKISZXzJJLtWtMmWDg,Brittany B.,90007

That is something that needs to be addressed. Yes, there's an option to park on the street, but you have people being disrespectful to one another over parking. Blocking the entire street, cutting each other off. There was a black SUV that almost hit my car as it squeezed in front of me  to cut me off and take my spot, although I had been waiting for 20 minutes since I arrived early, because I was already aware parking was challenging at this location. But that was just ridiculous and aggravating. I came to workout not to get involved in an car accident. That should not be the case, and it's unrealistic to expect people to allocate an additional 30 minutes just to park, specially with our fast paced lives. The staff, one individual in particular stood out, and he did not make a positive impression. On the contrary, Johnny was extremely unpleasant, rude and unwelcoming. It was my first visit there. There was no one at the front desk to check in with. I peeked around  to see who I could speak with. He finally came out of an office with a horrible attitude and demeanor towards me as if I was bothering him. He had a very condescending tone as he addressed me. It's unfortunate to have to give this location a bad rating because of these things that seem so insignificant and unimportant. Specially since the trainers are amazing! I had 3 of the the best workouts since I've joined. I love The Camp! The results are incredible no doubt! I've lost over 20 lbs. and I'm not done yet. This review however, is to allow the staff the opportunity to be conscientious of how negative interactions with their members can impact and affect The Camp's image. There's definitely room for improvement at this location.

I took before and after pictures and compared them side to side and wow you can tell the difference. Yeah a lot of people say that you don't need to pay so much to get those results, that you can just go to a regular gym, but honestly it's not true. The environment is so fun and encouraging. The trainers are all awesome and they push you to your limits. They will modify your workouts in case you have bad knees or something like that. As a challenger I never went to a different camp because honestly I just LOVED the trainers here. They give you the option to go to different camps and work out there but there was no need for me. I love how you dont do the same same excercise over and over again. Everyday is different as they focus just focus on upper, lower, middle, or full body work outs. The music is also a BIG  help when working out and it's fun how sometimes the trainers start to dance. Now the only down side is that  it is a bit expensive to become a memeber but they give you payment plans. And trust me, after working out with them it becomes addicting and you just wanna join..

,318 W 30th St,4.5,"Weight Loss,Centers,Boot Camps,Trainers",The Camp Transformation Center -  Los Angeles,201,5,Historic South Central,4/12/2016,"On 2/29 I began a 6 week weight loss challenge at The Camp Transformation Center in Los Angeles. The goal was to lose 20 pounds in 42 days. That sounded a little crazy to me at first, but then I started to read about and see pics of the challengers that had already successfully beat the challenge. I weighed in at 189.6 pounds with a nice muffin in the middle of my waist lol. Before beginning the challenge, I of course met with The Director of The Camp,  Luis Briceno who is the glue of The Camp and an excellent trainer. Luis is inspirational on an extremely high level. Weight loss has never been an easy trek for me. You need those wise pep talks. There is also George Val, better known as Care Bear. This dude is the sensitivity of The Camp! It blew me away when he began calling me by name the first day I came in to workout and I hadn't even put my name tag on yet. He's always there to answer questions and keep your head in The Camp! On top of that he is also a trainer that gets the job done! He will have you sweating from pores you didn't know existed. And lastly Every great institution needs a  Hype Man! That guy is Raul Arteaga. I call him The Butt Dr lol! This guy is military, funny, a dynamic ball of energy and a great trainer as well! So now I was told that I had to workout 5 days a week and given a strict diet that was totally doable. I had to meal prep and drink a gallon of water a day. We had a private Facebook group that consisted of challengers past & present that were a major support system all the way through. Believe me, I needed that group. This was one of the toughest journeys that I have ever embarked upon in my entire life. The Camp taught me so much. I now know how to eat in order to make my body a fat burning machine. I know that I can hit the gym hard and strong like never before. We all know that we need water for good health, but I now drink water all day everyday. I feel great. I was told I look younger too lol. This was one of the best decisions that I have made in my life for me. I can't believe how fast this all happened but of course with consistency, hard work and dedication! Every week I weighed in on Monday, I was just amazed by the results. The biggest rule of The Camp is FTDI ( Follow The Damn Instructions )! I did that, no matter what I thought i knew. You see I learned to TRUST THE PROCESS. I went in for my final weigh in yesterday morning and I now weigh 168.6 pounds. I lost 21 pounds in 42 days! If I did it, so can you. Go and visit The Camp at 318 West 30th Street, Los Angeles California 90007. The Camp Transformation Center Los Angeles will forever have my heart!

It's amazing how much of a lifestyle change can happen in 5 weeks. It takes a lot of hard work and healthy eating. It is so easy to fall back into old habits but this camp had everything needed to help me achieve my goal. The trainers and staff are all out there to see you succeed and they don't want you to fail. They will push you and help you in any ways possible. They have the experience and expertise to read what your body is going through and will find ways to jump start your body into achieving that goal.

I'm at my heaviest weight too. Other than that, I've had my spine surgery few years back and that's why the doctor told me I have to lose weight and start a healthy lifestyle. Few days after my check-up, I saw the camp ads in my Facebook feeds, it says ""Lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks"" and I've decided to sign up. I'm so glad I did and it was the best decision I've ever made! Yes, I can't do some extreme workouts but they will teach you how to do the modified version. Which still works cause I managed to lose 26.8 lbs in 6 weeks! I've never had such amazing results compared to other gyms, ever! I felt stronger, no more chest pains and palpitations. Even back pains are almost gone. I can't thank The Camp LA enough, I love the trainers and the members we support and give encouragements to each other and we became a family. Even my own family and friends wants to sign up after seeing my results. (Well, 2 of them already signed up for the next challenge).

I decided to join this program because I had heard very positive things from 2 of my friends who are currently part of the Camp. I also like the way you work out as a team by instructors who push you to the limit. I needed that because I have a gym membership and going to work out by yourself is not the same as being with a group of people who starting and ending the workouts together. I needed this since I suffer from anxiety & depression I needed something to keep my mind occupied & body strong. I know I've only been there for a week but I have not felt so happy and so much energy that I didn't have a couple days ago. The people are nice. Sandy who is the front desk is very sweet & always has a smile in her face when you walk in. She was able to answer my questions during the orientation.  The music during the workouts are the best I believe you have to have good music to pump you up. I'm going to say the workouts are not easy and there have been times I want to run out and quit but I see the drive and motivation in the people around me and that makes me know I can get through it. Make sure to bring water and a towel because you will be drenched in sweat during your whole work out. The only thing I do wish they had was more fans hahaha.. but other than that it's seems really good so far and I can't wait to make it to the finish line.,KEnqvNB9tyA_PfeAJpFO-A,Zuani O.,90007

I've learned so much in these 6 short weeks after taking on the Hardbody Challenge I was able to jump start what will be a constant lifestyle for me. I beat my challenge and hit my goal of losing 5.5% body fat by following the FTDI and exercise plan. The staff there is amazing and really want you to reach your healthy fitness goals. Teaching you and guiding you and most importantly giving you encouragement to keep pushing no matter how hard it gets. Becoming a part of the Transformation Camp family I've gained new friends and a host of knowledge of becoming a more healthy me! If anyone is looking to hit goals and becoming more confident this is the place to be! LA camp rocks. My only down fall is that I'm not able to continue because of other obligations in my personal life and since I've decided not to continue I won't be able to participate in any more challenges. I believe that's a hard penalty for those who may need to return later when things aren't so chaotic. Although I'm disappointed in the policy in that area LA CAMP still rocks!

They have a cool, industrial looking facility that makes it fun to work out at and funny trainers that keep the workouts interesting. I enjoyed the fact that they had early hours because I like working out out before I start the rest of my day.

I also meet great people who are on the same journey I am to live a healthy life style. The team in LA and other locations were very supportive and the classes definitely make you break a sweat. I think that if you are really committed to changing your health and need accountability or support then this program is a great way to start. I now have the opportunity to be a member and continue on my journey to being more conscious of what i am feeding my body. :),ZOAFo807soneAbVTKdr9PA,Rosa S.,90007

It is a life change for me.. They motivate you push you to do the best when you work out. It's a like a family work out. My experience with the camp has been great. They have taught me how to eat better and make better choices in food. I have seen with my own eyes people taking medication and have lost weight. When they go back to see their doctor they either reduce there meds or completely get off of it. This is what made me try out the camp transformation. This gym has awesome trainers any questions you have in regards to workouts and losing weight the healthy way this is the gym. Like one of my trainer says you getting healthy is priceless and  it's true.. I recommend this place to anyone.,dduIELYdv_H4MO5LFvYbgg,Sal R.,90007

,318 W 30th St,4.5,"Weight Loss,Centers,Boot Camps,Trainers",The Camp Transformation Center -  Los Angeles,201,4,Historic South Central,2/26/2017,"I have to start from the beginning. I attended to orientation in Dec. 2016 knowing there would have to be a catch to this ""free"" challenge. I was told the orientation would take 1 hour, my husband and I were there for 1.5 hours before they told us we'd have to give a ""$497 deposit,"" we laughed and bolted out (I did like to atmosphere they presented with the loud music). For the next few weeks I kept digging for information on the program and I ended up signing up because I needed to FINALLY do something to get healthy. I only found out that there was an orientation session the Saturday before the challenge started because I overheard a man asking/talking to the front desk so I had to go ask the front desk what that was about (otherwise I would not have known....my first week at the camp I met two people who were never told about the orientation session and had no idea what the booklet was about). I attended the info session with my husband where supplements the camp sells were advertised. The person giving the info session said that the founder/creator of the camp was a Doctor (nowhere on his page does the camp owner claim he is a Doctor of any sorts), the same person also claimed that the protein container was filled to the top, ""... not like others."" The protein (which I actually love *Chocolate* because it does not upset my stomach is about 2/3rds full, but it is about twice as expensive as other protein powders I've purchased in the past). Over the course of my first challenge I experienced a bit of consistency with the staff and the checking in process. The first week I was told 4 different in-person check-in procedures by 4 different staff members (they need to get it together). I also purchased the 21 day detox and was not e-mailed the eating plan, I found out I was entitled to it through the ""secret group page."" I was able to get it once I brought this up to the front desk. I know thus far it seems counterproductive for me to write this and give the camp 4 stars.... bear with me. I attend the morning classes so for the most part i see the same staff members. Unfortunately I have only found one trainer who seems to be genuine about his passion for helping people. Raul has been the only trainer who smiles and talks to people outside of the workout sessions. Most times there is one trainer who just doesn't seem to want to be there. Ok, now for the good stuff. From day one, the secret facebook page as well as the ladies in the classes have been incredible and a great support system. I've witnessed women pushing each other, encouraging each other and motivating one another to successfully complete the challenge. They were key for me to be successful in completing my first challenge! I lost well over 20 lbs and I haven't felt like this in a year. I have more energy throughout my hectic days and I feel so much happier. I didn't see much of a difference the first 4 weeks (I had lost around 15 lbs by this point), but soon after i did see a difference in my face. I FINALLY started to feel pretty again. I am so excited to start my second challenge and loose at least 20+lbs! ",DgPuwRhPblhWKIYW8cTEQw,Ivette L.,90007

The Camp Transformation Center continues to be a place I will highly recommend if you are serious about losing weight and a healthier life style. I'm not at my goal weight yet but I already feel better than 12 weeks ago. Who would've known that by the end of the summer I would accomplish this much.

Felt a bit discouraged already, and lost until i found The Camp Transformation Center pop up on my Facebook feed. Thought i'd try it out and i am so glad i did! In 6 weeks i lost 22lbs but not just that, i gained my endurance, my strength, my confidence and was able to get into my ""smallest"" size again. 6 weeks i gained people in the camp, not only encouraging one another but also became friends--- no, we became a family! 6 weeks made a huge difference, have to say it saved me from buying bigger clothes, and most of all it saved me from feeling sad about how i let myself go... I will be lying if i'll say the workouts were easy, or limiting my food choices were not a struggle. They were both a struggle but both were all worth it!!! I have noticed how i'm able to push through the workouts even a bit more from how i  started, and how the junk foods were less temptinng as they were before too. 6 weeks, you're body will thank you for it. 6 weeks, you will see a huge difference, may not mostly physical but you surely become better than you once were. It won't be perfect but guaranteed, if you give your all and ""follow the damn instruction"" - FTDI, you will progress maybe beyond you can imagine! ",ZFLN7fiUxoNbV-rSjskgiw,Hyame B.,90007

One day is ""Leg day"", the following day is ""Abs day"" and etc. so we don't miss getting the workout on different areas of our bodies. Everyday I get to book the class and time of preference on my basecamp app on my phone and get the details of what instructor is teaching and what the class consists of. It is very helpful to organize my day and making a decision and knowing how many people has booked the class.

To a competitive CrossFitter like myself it was a ""recovery workout"" but there were people of all fitness levels, ages, sizes and shapes here which was one of my favorite things about this place.

I literally just finished my first 6 week challenge yesterday. I am proud to report I am down 25.6 lbs. I couldn't be more happy with the result as I know that I would not have been able to do it without the camp, the trainers, the staff and even fellow challengers. The support system was incredible, we received support and encouragement from the coaches, staff and challengers who were on the same boat as ourselves. I spent so much time there during the last six weeks that I started feeling like I was at my home away from home. I will not lie, I always tell people that it is not an easy process because it isn't. You have to be willing to push yourself, to go beyond your limits and get out of your comfort zone because otherwise you might not succeed. Take it from the girl who was told by one of the coaches a couple of days into this ""I am sure you are nice person but in here you need to let some anger or frustration out, it's okay you are allowed"" At first I didn't know how to take that but soon I realized why he had said that to me. I was not pushing myself hard enough, not giving it all that I could give which I needed to do. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is serious about making a change in their lives because let me tell you it will change your life.

The free part I figured was a sales gimmick, but I went in happily about to shell out anywhere up to $200 for the 6 week program. It seemed hard and fun and the energy of the workouts seemed great. Right up my alley. But then when they got the the price... it is ""free"", they say, you just have to give a deposit just under $500 for a month and a half program. You only get the money back if you lose 20lbs of 5% body fat in addition to posting 5 star yelp reviews and checking in on Facebook 5 times a week. I have a background in contract administration so I wanted to look it over. I was told I wasn't allowed to take the contract out of the building. That seemed odd for someone asking for such a large deposit. Feeling uneasy about the experience, I went home and researched them. It seems this is a giant scam. They rarely return the money. All the 5 star reviews are people just trying to get their money back. The contract has very very small font and front and back. Please be careful! If your gut tells you something is off, it is. Don't fall for this. I hope they leave Silver Lake soon and free up the primo real estate for something more honest. Big bummer because it would have been a good work out.  People happily throw down substantial monthly income for exercise classes in this neighborhood. Just be straightforward. They don't need to trick people into it.

All the gauges were in red, my family suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes. After seeing those results I knew I had to make changes to my diet and way of life. A few friends and coworkers were participating or had completed the challenge, and watching them succeed in their weight loss journey inspired me! I went to the orientation with my mind made up, I didn't need to hear the speech I just wanted to sign up and start exercising. The first few workouts were some of the most humbling experiences in my life, I kept asking myself ""wtf did I get myself into?"" I started to see results the first week, clothes were fitting me better, people kept complimenting me, and most importantly I started to feel better not so sluggish and lazy anymore. This program is not for everyone, you need to be disciplined  and remember to work hard, and most important  FOLLOW THE DAMN INSTRUCTIONS!

I enjoyed my time here while working out. This camp reminded me how good it feels after working out and how fruitful it is as you see your weight goes down. Well for me I enjoyed wearing my old clothes that didn't fit anymore. There is no magic pill for weightloss. This camp will guide you and all you need to do is bring you best foot forward and follow the instructions. I always give my 200% everytime the workout starts even if I'm sick. You should make every seconds count and push your self beyond the limit that you've impossed on yourself. Trainers will remind you of good posture and proper exercise. The only thing that you need to bring into this camp is your mental strength and perseverance. My tip is always plan ahead. You'll get used to the parking situation and always bring towel and water. Hope you guys sign up as you will be doing yourself a favor. This camp is not about weightloss but it is about having a better health for a better future.,yKUwPrdeeVz20A0awANqmA,Dave E.,90026

I had been thinking of joining a gym to lose a bit of weight but had been hesitant sense I'm never really sure what kind of exercise to do. I aleays seem to end up running on the treadmill. She then told me a little about The Camp she attended out in Orange County. She told me there are trainers that guide you and help you on what to eat and what not to eat. Also that is was fun and the work outs really work. So then I did some research and found The Camp in Silverlake which was the closes to me. I went in one day to see what it was about and what there philosophy was. I spoke to one the girls working there and stayed for there introduction to the program of 6 weeks 20 pounds. They went over meal prepping. I then decides to give it a chance and signed up. Let me tell you meal prepping was not easy, since I had never done it and luckily my wife was very helpful. It was a big change in my eating habits. Since I love burgers and pizza but I know it was for the best to change things up. It took about 2 weeks to get use to getting my meals ready since it's best eating every 2.5 to 3 hours. I would include protein shakes on every other meal. On the first class that I attended I met Cameron who is one of the trainers there. Let me tell you it was not easy especially since I didn't  work out at all. I felt sore for the following 3 days. As the days went by the work outs started to feel a bit easier and my body was less sore. Leg days with Josh were no joke but again as long as you do your best and push yourself it only get a easier with each work out. I started to take BCAA to help with the sore muscles which they tell you to use to help you body heal. I am done with the 6 week challenge and met my goal of 25.2  pounds. I feel better and healthier. The program does help as long as you do your part  work out, eat right and drink your water. Because you have to drink 1 gallon of water a day. The trainers there are really helpful and motivated me to give it my all.",QaXtoR2qeRoW2LIa45NmLw,Eddie S.,90026

To be honest, I was just making excuses thinking, I can keep trying to lose weight on my own. I was scared of failing. This year I was determined to change my life style and I thought ""why not try something different""? I was on Instagram one day and my aunt posted a picture of her ""before and after"" and I was amazed on how great she looked after losing 24 lbs in 6 weeks by joining this program. Knowing someone close to me and hearing their successful story was that push I needed, so without anymore hesitation  I joined The Camp 6 weeks ago. The exercises are absolutely great and so much fun. This is coming from someone who didn't play much sports in high school and with little experience when it comes to being active. Coaches Cameron and Joshua are incredible! Extremely helpful and passionate about fitness and health. They both have very different personalities and styles which kept me on my toes during exercise routines; Cameron is such a professional, he challenges you, pushes you and is always checking your technique reminding you that your body is capable of SO much if you put your mind to it, while Joshua who also challenges you, is fun, humorous, humble which makes him super approachable and gets down to business when it comes to his exercising routines. During the 6 weeks, I never visited another site and this was because, one, the location was so convenient for me, two, parking was easy and three, because this place made me feel so welcomed. The program director Frances is extremely helpful, I had so many questions and doubts throughout the 6 weeks and she was always available to answer my questions through messages on Facebook and in person. She too was a member who has been so successful in this journey, now competing in various competitions, so she can totally relate to the many struggles that this journey can bring. Eliza is also another person who makes this location so great. She's one of the sweetest person I've ever met. She helps out Frances and greets you with a big smile when coming in. She's really knowledgeable and helpful, willing to answer all your questions and has this warmth to her that makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in. Eliza also has a successful story as an alumni and previous member. The members in this location are great! You develop a community of support when becoming a member. People who you can vent with and relate to when going through this journey. We have a good mix of people, from different ages, to different ethnicities and different health goals. I guess, it's a good mirror to the actual community in Silverlake. I'd recommend this place to anyone. I had my last weigh-in today and I'm so happy to announce that I'm down 26 lbs. I want to be honest, it hasn't been easy but this place has definitely given me all the knowledge and support I need. I'll be able to join the second challenge which starts on April 16 and I'm super excited. This is by far one one ",W3EDrcYM2RcKwBB2RLzomA,Daisy A.,90026

I know my body and I know what to do!"" well you know what I put the ego away and realized that if I really knew my body I wouldn't have been in this situation, I would be super ripped and fit. So, I decided to just to STFU and go FTDI. They are right, it's not a temporary thing. It's a lifestyle. It's a change of life. You really see how much one cheat meal can really affect your progress. You live and learn. I learned the hard way. In the beginning I was broken and weak I gave in many times. I was sore, tired and beat. I was ready to give up. But what changed it all was every morning at the camp during our workout I'd look at all the people on the wall that have done it and lost so much weight and succeeded and beat the challenge! Something snapped! I started to push harder! I started to lift heavier! Day after day I try to be better than who I was yesterday. With the help with all the amazing trainers at the camp and all the support you get for the community of challengers and champions and amazing support I got from my fiancé. I did it! 6 weeks and 21.7lbs lighter. I effing did it! Never hold back! Always push! Remember don't cheat yourself. The only one that is going to affect is you! You have everything you need to succeed. You have the camp and the support from others. You got this! The camp is amazing. I recommend this to everyone that wants to lose that extra ""Junk in the trunk"". ",cnNyNABjGoPwCQ4CXNaW4A,Diah L.,90026

So when I first came to the camp and saw all these photos my first thought is automatically negative...But then you actually not only see the people in the photos, but people in your classes KNOW The people in the photos.. & on top of that... most of your trainers here, directors, owners have gone through the program themselves...AND CONTINUE TO ACCEPT CHALLENGES INTO THEIR LIVES MONTHLY...  It's actually super cool see such an inspiring story and know that person wants to share their story and coach to help others. At The Camp Silverlake you have such an awesome team to work with. I just finished my 6 week program and lost almost 24lbs. From one of the most humble men I've ever met...Luis the owner, to his sweet GF Bernie, our director Frances & everyone else who helps on a weekly basis... Josh, Cameron, Darren, Joel, Rick... you guys are all amazing and come in each week and have our back. The reason I love it here so much is the sense of community as well. Before I signed up with the Camp I used to have a membership to Equinox... all they ever cared about was bringing in more guests, or paying a lot of money for training... wanna get stretched out? Thats about $60-$80 itself....yes JUST TO STRETCH.. Other than the eucalyptus towels and saunas it was a waste of money. I'm very thankful that a Silverlake location was opened. I'm now a member of this gym, where you go for about 45-50min, get your butt handed to you, make some new great friends, and feel like you belong somewhere special. Everyone inside of this place may not have the same goals... BUT we all have goals..and it has to do with workout out and eating healthier.. creating a better us.. and we Lift one another up every single day...and I love that. Your color, weight, goals...nothing matters in The Camp.. and thats how it should be. ",NyTS62hJdr-7DybSm1y_5w,El S.,90026

They just looked at me like I was nuts. The staff then said they don't use class pass anymore and that there's been 'a few of us' who have had this problem. Basically in so many words, they told me it's not their problem and I should take it up with ClassPass. So here I am, at 6:00 in the morning, being refused from this workout and getting charged $ from ClassPass for not checking into the class. They offered no solution and were completely unapologetic.

Do not rely on the staff because many need to be educated themselves before they can even help others. Educate yourself on the process. Surround yourself with positive knowledgeable individuals who know how to push you in to success. This transformation is about bettering yourself, not any particular trainer.

My motivation to start this journey was just a number on a scale and this ""before picture"". It's funny to think that now the number seems so irrelevant.. My goal evolved from just Loosing weight as I realized I'm more interested in gaining Strength, Health and Self Confidence. I can't explain how PROUD of myself I am every single day and how GOOD I feel about myself! I find myself celebrating the Tiny (and to others maybe insignificant) victories, like the extra inches on that box jump, being able to bench even if it's JUST the bar or even not feeling like I'm DYING on our run to western.. There hasn't been one day where I haven't walked in to my bootcamp class and walked out in a better mood ready for my day.

Amazing in every way. First off, I came in here doubting myself with low self esteem as well as low confidence. I'm a dancer and I was in the worse shape of my life. Coming here brought me back to life. I started with the bootcamp and then tried to the 6 week transformation challenge. You start with a very important orientation to get you going and he provides you with so much information. Once you start your bootcamp classes or the transformation you have dates and times set based on your schedule. You show up to class and kick ass and always do your best and work hard: they provide you with meal plans and you stick to the plan. Little by little you see results and WOW! I was seeing results after the 1st week. Armando the owner and genius that I mentioned before is your biggest fan and believer. He will work your butt off and support you from the minute you walk in till you leave the place after your workout. This place rocks. You meet so many friendly people that do not judge and just pump you up throughout the whole workout. You really are dealing with a team here. You are guided with meal and food plans and you are always learning something new every day. I love the inspirational talks before and after the workout. I so recommend this place if you want to change your life for good. Trust me you will not be disappointed.",COqjSKX59-SPmlowthqwpA,Graciela D.,90710

Armando not only shows us the correct type of ways of exercising, but also explains how imperative it is to stick to your meal plan. The great thing is that the workouts are for all age groups. It is a friendly group atmosphere. Each individual works at their own pace, but Armando does ask for progress to be made on a weekly basis. You also get weighed and measured every week, which is a great thing because you get to see if you have made progress, or see what changes might you need to make in your daily life. Armando and his staff truly show the passion and love for their job and it definitely shows on a daily basis. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

He knows how to pay attention to you throughout every workout even if there's 30 of you there! And if you're having a bad day he comes full of good advice and actually wants to hear you out. This isn't like any other gym. I have never felt like a gym instructor has taken the time to not only help me with my work outs and be super encouraging but also be a friend. I don't ever want to go to another gym again. I now don't hate going to the gym... I actually can't wait to see the people I've been getting to know there and workout. 100% suggest Fitness and Fun to anyone trying to find a gym that you'll absolutely love coming too.,qkDbPg3A_IS9ejmLYgEsUg,Rachel D.,90710

We loved the previous location on PCH and Anza, but this one was closer to home.. It's worked out because the space is TWICE as big! I find the 5am class to be the best since it gives my day a kick start. I also love Saturday mornings @ 730am because we can bring a guest. Mike (the trainer) is full of energy and even when I started to have pseudo-sciatica issues, he's helped me with stretching and pain relief to help me recover faster. Armando (the owner) is inspiring, motivating and his nutritional emails and tips help my wife and me lose those extra poundsIf I could, I'd give FFTC 6 stars. Thanks to Mando and the team!",tvRXZrd_hedm7XwqTM7M9Q,Tony A.,90710

I never was a workout buff but knew I needed something so I went online and stumbled upon Fitness and Fun Boot Camp. It had the word Fun in the name so I thought, why not. This place is not only fun but the people are encouraging and the coaches push you and take the time to make sure your doing things right or give you alternative exercises based on ability. I just finished my trial off and am planning to commit for the rest of the year and take it from there. To be continued...",rsnuD0JJGZQ6Lpzg1ii00A,Kevin C.,90710
