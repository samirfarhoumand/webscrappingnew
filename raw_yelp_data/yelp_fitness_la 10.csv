What I did not expect was that he would call me back again, that same night, and offer me a free private lesson as a warm welcome to LA.

The young man at the desk, Freeman, was very polite, courteous, and prompt. However, I was told I would have to take a private lesson before I would be allowed to join the beginners class to make sure it was the right class for me, and not too advanced. I was advised even though it was called a beginners class, it was really an intermediate one. Why I couldn't join the beginners class and after that one class be told ""yea or nay,"" I do not know--except that forcing private lessons is a great road to profit.  Beginners beware! Perhaps Dance Doctor could simply stop advertising a beginners class if they aren't offering one. There are better ongoing beginners classes to find without the scam angle of ""evaluation private lesson.""  About a mile away is Cristian Oviedo for one, and I am sure there are equally others.

One would think that at the second dance lesson you would have at least 50% of the steps complete, we insisted that we wanted simple steps to make the dance nice but simple, As I am reading from other peoples comments it seems as though it is quite common that Jon or his instructors choose their own dance/steps to make it more difficult and make you have to go back for more classes and or buy his packages on a very ""hard sell"" this is my first time writing a review on someone's business, but I feel as though this is so unfair and hope that another bride gets to read this and not commit the same mistake I did. He charges $150 for 45 minute lesson, which by the way starts getting subtracted the minute you get inside the studio.

There, the dance instructors were able to choreograph dance moves to the song we chose and made us look like we knew what we were doing on the dance floor. I didn't want to be that couple, who, just swayed back and forth to a song while our guests just stared at us. The instructors were so patient with us and would change, modify and adapt to whatever we needed. Not only were they amazing dancers, but even more, amazing teachers. They broke down every step so we could perfect it and memorize it before adding on more. Learning to dance at the studio was an amazing experience that we will cherish forever.

She devised an amazing routine for us that was a mix of elegance and fun and taught us moves that were simple to somewhat more technical, a good mix for me and my husband.

Sarah was always extremely patient and gracious when advising us the dance moves we needed to improve upon but also extremely encouraging and motivating when we did something well and we can't recommend her enough as a dance instructor!",Qzuc3Jn0QS1bXQhzVmYtKw,A B.,90401

Javier is a great teacher as well and has a large following. He really cares and will work with you to get the moves down. Jose's class is also great. He practices and teaches like a classically trained dancer and will help you with all of the nuanced moves.

It's available very few hours daily . Super early when everyone sleep and when everyone on their job. The rest of the time they train high schoolers probably the town pay for it. So forget about the pool 2) you won't find many necessary equipment here. Some machine might be out of order for long (1-3 months). 3) employees working with kids in the play room don't love their work (except one awesome blond lady. She's super nice). 4) when I ask to borrow a jump rope they sometimes ask me to leave my id as a guarantee I bring it back .. very odd 5) most of the people don't know that they need to return weight and rerack their equipment (who cares ?) May be just too many young people who are not familiar with a gym culture ... This gym is in 3 min walking from my home - the only reason I'm still here. I'm moving out of the areas soon tho.

It's also misleading since the group class schedule has descriptions such as ""Boot Camp"" and ""H.I.I.T IT!"" but those classes are not actually offered. ",QHVzq1PKK8TFOEUXfYIn4A,Cindy S.,91502

First of all, their kid's swimming lessons are ridiculous. We tried to put our three year old in their water acclimation class, but because they over chlorinated the water in the small pool they made these tiny kids jump in and hang onto the side of the big pool - how is that ACCLIMATING THEM? My kid freaked out, so we sat on the side of the pool with him to calm him down and try to get him back into the water, but then suddenly we're unceremoniously told we have to leave after the first five minutes - so basically our kid is either going to sit there on his own outside of the pool, scream his face off while in a deep ass pool, or go home. We went home. I put in for a refund and it took three weeks, an email, and five calls to get my money back because the woman who runs the swim department can't keep herself organized. Oh I should also mention that the instructor wasn't who we were told it would be, we never got a confirmation email about the class or if we were signed up, meaning we also had no idea how the class worked/what we needed to bring, and we still don't have a confirmation that the class was canceled, though I did JUST see the money go back into my account (a month later)",XYkSsovOjGD3Z6IudgHwMQ,Cindy L.,91502

They used to have some really great programs for youth and were well-staffed by friendly and helpful employees. Old heads will remember Amanda White's amazing spin class- they let a great thing get away. But I stuck around for the boxing club. Lately they seem to be more concerned with ""improving"" the aesthetic and less with member experience. They've reduced the amount of equipment available in the cardio room and as part of the recent upgrade. It was fine before, in my opinion. But change is inevitable. What can you do? What compelled me to write this review is that, although they close at 10pm, in the last couple of weeks staff has been shutting rooms down 10-15 minutes prior to get people out of the gym by closing (which still doesn't necessarily occur). I'd love to stop working 10-15 minutes early every day and start packing up so I'm out the door right when I'm off but the reality is I still have to answer calls and emails while I'm on the clock. I can't understand why it should be any different here. However, they're shutting lights off in the basketball court as early as 9:45 and in the cardio room as early as 9:50. Tonight Travis, the MOD, rudely chased myself and two other paying adult members out of the observation deck at 9:50 while we were stretching and doing floor work. When I inquired as to why, he was clearly irritated by my question. He was unpleasant as I tried to explain that because I come to work out later in the evening, that 10 minutes makes a difference to me and I've never been chased out of a room in that manner in the entire time I've been a member. I've been really happy to refer friends to the YMCA, especially for the boxing program, but if this is how you're going to start treating guests and cutting our workouts short, I wouldn't feel comfortable continuing to do so. This is why people are leaving the Y in favor of the newer gyms or Defiant. I understand and am leaving in that direction myself.",ShBTs59AtF4plOLYuglNRQ,Bree N.,91502

Came back to him holding my personal items and putting them on another bench outside the stall and he just stared at me as he continued. I told him not to touch my stuff and he groaned at me.

That being said, there are many folks out there who aren't into the 'Who's Who in Martial Arts' so it's mainly for them that I put my thoughts down... As a new student I have to say that I'm very impressed with the staff. It was a busy evening when I signed up but they made me feel welcome.  I've also felt very welcome in working out with the other students, some of whom have trained there for many years but they were very welcoming and patient with me as a training partner on drills.  I'm studying Silat and FMA (Filipino Martial Arts).  There is good access to a variety of classes on the schedule for me so I feel I have ample opportunity to get my money's worth in class hours. As a new student, there are times when I feel challenged during warmups and new techniques which could make a newbie feel uncomfortable but I feel that it's part of the journey.  If you're a 'shopper', you may not see the value in the Inosanto Academy or anywhere else for that matter.  But, if you're looking for quality training and an 'ocean's depth' of martial arts knowledge, I think you'll be drawn there.  I plan to post again after several weeks of training to focus more on instruction.",tcCrHbvCS_Mo1HcWmFsVFQ,Eddie R.,90292

I took my daughter to class. I enrolled here in the tiger tots program for 5-7 year olds. We went to the first class for free which is about 50 minutes. The class started 10 minutes late with the instructor not in sight. When the class finally did start and the instructor was warming them up someone pulled the instructor out of class and threw in a desk person to take over. They were gone for well over 15 minutes before returning. Half the class my daughter was sitting on the floor and I saw her do one karate move. After the class was over I was approached by one of the desk staff with a contract to sign my daughter up for one class a week for $140 a month!!! I was furious. Why would I pay that much for a class that basically did not happen. Then about a month later- near my daughter's birthday- I received a call asking me what I had planned for her birthday and if I would like to have one at karate kids. I was beyond shocked. I told them that I never signed up  and was in fact very disappointed with the first class. The fact that they called me to spend more money on a worthless karate party was unbelievable. This company did not even take the time to take my name out of their computer system after I clearly showed no interest in their program. There are much better programs out there for kids that are much more reasonably priced. Dawn Barnes Karate Kids does not give you your money's worth and is not worth the time.,goJ_8kty3Bm3i-Ljw6QBew,C H.,90403

Then, because of a Groupon deal, I decided to try Core Yoga. Not only did they honor the groupon deal of a month for one low price, they added their one week free as well - so they combined offers which most places do not do. So far all the instructors are fantastic: easy to understand, patient, not militant, and very generous with their time after class if you have questions.   The other participants in class are also super cool: there is no sense of judgment, or any stuck-up attitudes. The facility is clean and open and has an excellent vibe.   Not particular to this studio - but why do guys get to do yoga with no shirt on and women don't? Not that I want to. But I also don't really want to see the dudes without their shirts on either. Double Standard?",YpKBB58LSMEUYp18qO7gNw,Delilah G.,90025

The only problem with this location is the fact that silence in the studio isn't taken seriously. I usually like to get to class early and meditate. This is always ruined by the chatty girls who make their way into the studio early. They don't even try to whisper.

I have been to a million yoga classes at many different yoga studios, but I've never quite experienced the same mind/body connection anywhere else. Core Power was the first place I've ever done yoga consistently, and it was a wonderful foundation for my practice. This studio is perfect for anyone who is starting out or wants to expand their knowledge/skill. The instructors here spend a lot of time educating everyone on the proper techniques. I thought I would dislike the fact that it's heated 100% of the time, but to me it was surprisingly energizing and only added to the experience. Be prepared to sweat like you've never sweat before.

Her vocal instructions were very clear, I could feel the genuiness of her intent, and the class flowed very smoothly from posture to posture. She is an asset to that studio and to CorePower. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is NOT because of Alexandra, it's because the room is way too small. There were maybe 30 people in class and we were packed in like sardines.

The negatives would be super small women's change area and each time I've been the floors were not mopped so there was sweat puddles from the previous class. I'm a stickler for sanitary environments.

A variety of classes and walking distance! Also, parking is included which is a huge plus. Just make sure you get it validated and DON'T lose the ticket. I love all the teachers here - my favorites are C2, C1.5, and Hot Power Fusion. I need to try and do more sculpt classes because I took one for the first time a few months back and almost passed out. It is intense! I have always taken advantage of the groupon passes they offer a few times a year. To be completely honest, I only come here when they have the one month unlimited groupon pass for $75. Otherwise, I'm not sure if I'd be willing to pay regular prices since it's pretty pricey. One big downside I've noticed is that some of the more popular classes - particularly the C2 class at 6pm is ALWAYS packed. I honestly think they should reconsider trying to squeeze in 40 people in that room. I really don't like rubbing SWEATY elbows with only one inch space between the next person. Plus everyone sweats a lot so if you are packed in like that, it starts to stink and sometimes I've even gotten someone's sweat dripped on me which is disgusting. That's my ONLY negative thing to say about this place. I really thought with the Westwood location opening, that this location might free up a bit but I guess it's just that popular! Other then that, everyone should try this out.",wOlo2xmxrtvtnWvcaCPOdA,Sara Y.,90025

Ive practiced Bikram for many years and its a breath of fresh air to do a Hot Yoga class with other styles to choose from than just the set 26 poses (at Bikram).

I took two classes during my free session, the first one was good, lots of relaxing vibes, the second one pretty bad, mostly due to the horribly loud dub-step and Britney music they played the whole time- so loud that I couldn't hear what the teacher was saying. I hadn't consulted the schedule, so it turned out this class was more of a toning variation with free weights. Not quite yoga, more aerobics. The facilities were very clean and nice, the teachers were nice too, I just didn't find it to match my typical yoga experience.",erZVDepqXLx9eOATkYKT2Q,Owen K.,90025

I'm not a yogi, because I don't enjoy yoga anywhere... I just LOVE yoga at Corepower Wilshire! And they have an app to see who's teaching and what time. Super helpful. First week free.

I went into class dragging my feet after a long work day, but left feeling enlightened and tremendously happier.  I highly recommend taking either of their classes, they are such dedicated teachers who really spend time on their flow sequence and ensuring each student reaches their physical and mental potential.  Aside from that, they are just warm and loving people who are passionate about being at yoga.  Their contagious spirit will make you feel the same. Having Alexandria adjust during the 75 min C3 was nothing short of incredible, people who were newer to yoga felt secure in pushing themselves to their limits because there were instructors helping them without the possibility of injury. I highly suggest to CPY corporate that you consider having designated classes where there is an instructor there to adjust students and allow them to go deeper into their practice, it makes all the difference and keeps members coming back.  ",QzWXC1lLTUoWVztXjjyjZg,Jamie T.,90025

I usually take the Hot Power Fusion with Kylee on Thursdays. She used to teach on both Tuesdays and Thursdays but she stopped teaching on tuesdays due to her other obligations. But Kylee is really really really great! I love the passion and energy she brings to the class as well as the really fun music playlist!  I also really enjoy taking her class because she helps guide your breathing all throughout the entire class. Other instructors I've had just tell you to breath in the beginning but doesnt really help you focus in on the technique of breathing. This is really important because some of the yoga poses can be difficult and you start to focus on how to master the pose, while forgetting the breathing routine. However while you are trying to focus on mastering the pose, Kylee reminds you time and time again on keeping up with the breathing. ",lLZZ_Q7eBDn4J82ncDEYPA,Kathleen C.,90025

CPY has obviously grown to be a national studio since then. I can say, without hesitation, that the principals and ideas that CPY originally started with are still being shared and practiced at this CPY location. Every instructor is warm, thoughtful and makes you feel as if your practice is as important to them as their own practice. I try to get to the studio 5 times a week. My favorite instructors/classes are Brad's Hot Power Fusion (as well as his C2), Missy's C2 class, and Alexandria's Hot Power Fusion class. Hiromi is also a GREAT instructor, but she isn't on the schedule the same time every week. The classes can get a bit packed, but if you can shift your focus to your practice, then the closeness of others to you is not a huge concern. There have been a few times when the class was simply TOO packed, and the instructors kept letting people in, which can be frustrating to those of us that arrived early enough to secure a comfortable spot. However, in the last 2 weeks I haven't had an issue with the class being TOO packed. It seems as if there has been a cap placed on the classes. If you want a warm or hot yoga practice, that strengthens your mind as much as it does your body, this is the studio. It has been absolutely essential for me on those days when the craziness of living in Los Angeles gets to me.  THANKS CPY!!!!",yM01M11aQJ19BmwREGonzw,Nikki C.,90025

For instance, I showed up for a class at 9pm tonight, only to be told it was canceled. How hard is it to get a backup instructor for a Core Restore class? Additionally, I am pregnant and cannot take heated classes. They offer two ""unheated classes"". They often schedule those unheated classes directly after their HOTTEST classes. Seems like pretty basic strategy to not do something so retarded. Once, I was in an unheated class, and I noticed it was feeling very warm. I check the thermostat, and saw that it was creeping up to 90. I stepped outside to let the girls at the front know, and went back to class. 30 minutes later, class was over, and they had done nothing about it. I talked to the manager, who told me that they ""do not disturb classes in progress."" So why not just crack one of the two doors leading to the room, I queried. She ""had not thought of that.""

I would only recommend Marxel's classes if you are VERY in shape/athletic (lots of people at this studio are)... or have been doing hot yoga for a while.. for a first-timer it was borderline tortuous !!",7byL9HaHUnQt80_FAM9sEQ,C L.,90025

I decided to come back for the 8:15 class to try my luck once more.  AGAIN, NO PARKING.  I ended up just leaving all together and just wasted about 2 hours of my life.  The second time I came even earlier (around 6:30...for a 7:15 class -_-) and finally found a tiny parking spot to squeeze into.  CPY can only validate for up to 90 mins and then its $2 for every 15 minutes after that (cash or check only).  I just can't justify paying for additional parking every single time on top of what you're already paying for the classes.  Although 90 min should be doable since classes are only 1 hour, but once you factor in parking, changing, the possibility of class starting late/running late, etc., you are really cutting it close.  Also, another pet peeve I have with this location is that they lock their doors to the whole studio until 30 mins before your class, which just adds to the list of inconveniences of this location.  Sooo I get there early to find parking and now I am just stuck outside.  The studio is pretty tiny and I believe there are only 2 rooms.  I usually like their Sculpt class because it incorporates weights into your workout, but the instructor for that day was just not my cup of tea.  Kudos to her high level of energy, but her flow and music selection was not really my style.  The class did end up running over a little bit and I noticed that a couple students ended up leaving the class early due to the parking time restraint, which is a shame because they emphasize on keeping your focus on the present/current state of mind during your practice, which obviously does not happen here.  I ended up having to pay for $4 for parking so I guess you can say finding parking is doable, but honestly who has the time or wants to fork out extra cash every time they want to work out?",QF3FJ_lLCGUrYk_vamsRaA,Lily T.,90025

The company of Corepower is amazing because it really incorporates a more modern feel to yoga. I love the sculpt classes because it combines an amazing workout for the mind and body all to great music. (A definite plus) When it comes to this location in particular, the crowd can be quite large. It gets a little annoying that they don't put a cap on the amount of people in class. The major crowds result in no personal space to relax, and can create a tense environment. I've had a few run ins with people that were rude about finding a place in class. It definitely pays to come early to avoid any confrontations. Other than that, love the classes and studio.",3ZJsdnwkP5-N0uE5LuJFcw,Isabel B.,90025

I used to go to class a few times and week, and took break for a bit and remembered I had money on my account so I tried the Wilshire studio. I could not have been more disappointed. It started when I tired to call the studio and they connect you to corporate, put you on hold until someone NOT in the studio picks up, they can't answer your questions because they have never actually been to the studio. Parking is awful. The front desk is was rude, she also happened to be the teacher. The class was SO packed everyone's mats were basically touching each other, which is disgusting. I don't need or want anyone's sweat dripping on my mat. They do not allow anyone to sign up so they pack as many people in as they can. There are so many people in the class I can't even see the instructor to see what we're doin next so I spent half the class looking around seeing what everyone else was doing. She never came around once and fixed anyone's form because she was too stuck on one side of the room. The class looked like a free for all. Once the money on my account is all gone I will not be back. There are tons of other studios in LA that offer heated yoga and sculpt without mass amounts of people and teachers who pay attention to their students.",gyJJwTuYFnM4l4OHbMk1GQ,Nicole V.,90025

Seriously, I don't think I've ever had a good class here and I'm not sure if it's because there's not enough room for instructors to teach properly, or because the instructors are just that bad.

So when I moved to LA I was nervous to find a new routine. I have been enjoying core power yoga. It's definitely more work out oriented than spiritual. The sculpt class is basically sun sals and then aerobics with weights. But it's a good mix of classes and I have found the teachers solid and encouraging. The C1 and C2 classes are a good basic flow, slightly heated with abs in the middle. Haven't tried hot power fusion yet but that one is heated more. It's expensive but all yoga is. One complaint is no sign ups in advance on their app so it can get crowded and you have to get their early.",FA-X9QZ5ATMbpPIKSFefKw,Alyssa H.,90025

I just can't get my mind in a place to enjoy it but I cam to CorePower through a friend's invitation and I feel the Yoga Sculpt classes are a good mix of meditation and a kick-ass workout. I've gone to two classes on a free 1-week pass and I feel that both workouts were superb. The plaza provides 90-mins free parking with validation from CorePower but if you are looking for a spot, there may be parking down Westgate or Armacost, which is just a short walk away from CorePower. As for the class, it's a good mix of aerobics, yoga, weights, and straight up butt kicking. The room is heated and although both times I've gone the heater has been broken, the heat within the room is warm enough that you are still drenched with sweat when you are done. The room can get a bit crowded, which is also why I docked it down a star because it just gets so cramped with so many people in the room. Since it's first come first serve, you can't guarantee a seat similar to the SoulCycle model. But it can get cramped... Overall though, the classes are great and it's a good transition for those that just can't get into yoga. There are other classes, which I haven't tried, but they are meant to be more yoga-ish. Definitely worth at least a week attempt. Nothing to lose other than tons of water weight and maybe a couple of pounds. GIT IT!",Vi_qBZBXgkNbsO1qXXkoVw,Kevin L.,90025

I've never done yoga before and I joined CPY in august. I've never felt more stress free, relaxed, and happy in my life! First off, I WAS NEVER INTO YOGA! I thought yoga is super slow and that I have no patience for it. Also, I have bad balance and I'm not flexible. My roommate loved CPY so I decided to try one week free. I decided to start off with C1 because I had never done yoga before. It was really relaxing. After a while I took C2, sculpt, and hpf. I can officially say that I'm obsessed with yoga and can't believe I waited this long to try it. The order of my favorite classes are HPF, C2, Sculpt, and C1. However all are great! I love how there is so many hours and times for classes. ",KUg-1vCPRF_vFWqCqvHCGw,Colette Y.,90025

The premise is basic and simple; does not offer amenities for a ""spa experience"". The only reason I go to Daily Calm is the quality of the massage, hence the masseuse herself.

The specialty classes are a great compliment to the whole experience as well. No contract just walk in and pay or use square cash which is super simple.

No shop.  Utilitarian website.  An unusual absence among the instructors of swanky yoga wear.  No front desk; payment is by membership or the honor system.  A basket is placed discreetly on a bench, which imparts a feeling of contributing one's share to the community rather than payment per se.  Of course, even yogis have to eat, but this place gets as close as a for-profit venture can to the ideal. What a gift to offer an experience of this caliber for $10! Everything is thoughtfully arranged, and the overall effect is one of the harmony that comes from decisions on every level being guided by a clear value system.  You can intuit the reach for purity in both business and the practice. The environment: entrance at street level (welcome), studio sunken (the adventure's inside).  Earth tones and materials.  Lovely choices of functional items and very few things that are purely ornamental.  The instruction:  I have taken classes with five instructors here, and all are well above the norm.  I find Jerome Mercier and Jay Co gifted, though.  What sets their classes apart, I think, is their ability to powerfully express their personalities through their yoga. Many times, a teacher will describe their guidance as ""playful"", for instance, and I'll come out of the class not really knowing what that means. It may be that they had a good sense of humor or that we did lots of inversions, but the playfulness, the person, didn't find expression in the practice as a whole--or at least it wasn't conveyed.  Jerome and Jay are somehow mysteriously able to accomplish that, and this specificity makes their instruction universal; I can find myself and my own ways through it.  Their expert sequencing serves so much more than preparing the body. I am a sporadic practitioner myself, and I can only imagine the swift and deep progress that could be made by someone dedicated. Maybe that's you! There is a feeling of family about the place.  Oftentimes, Jay stands at the door and sees everyone out.  If you are taking the time to read these reviews, I hope you will give Yogaraj a shot.  It's a special studio.",ocu1tE1XP-n2QrX2SBG5Hg,Sue K.,90025

I went to my first yoga class here on a Thursday afternoon with Jay. Jay was beyond friendly, and I really enjoyed chatting with him before class started for a bit. A very cool, laidback, down-to-earth guy. The studio itself is definitely different from what I've experienced before---as others have mentioned, there is no front desk. Therefore, you have to wait outside until the instructor opens the door. And you drop your $10 in a basket before or after class. Other than that idiosyncrasy, they've got mats, cubbies, and a bathroom like most other yoga studios. The yoga space itself is very simple, but I liked its humble simplicity. The class I went to was small (with about 6 people), and it was a Vinyasa class. It was an EXCELLENT workout (I was sweating and will definitely be sore tomorrow), and I left feeling more calm and in a better mood. If I end up living in West L.A., I would definitely consider making this my regular studio! Thanks for an awesome class, Jay.",znZn1MlnKgJ4QduHKwmHWg,Diane G.,90025

They have a new student promotion that is $10 for 10 days of classes. This really allowed me to get in a lot of yoga (I went maybe 6 or 7 times during those 10 days) , and after many years of going on and off to yoga classes, I finally got to feel and see the benefit of yoga. I am so glad I signed up for that offer and that they even offered it to begin with. The teachers have all been awesome, as others have said, the classes are great, and no pretentious vibe from either the students or teachers. I have been going more to Christine and JayCo - I love how zen their energy is but in a very genuine way, nothing fluffy or  ""LA ish"" . I ended up buying a package on my own at the end of the promotion because I really want to keep it up.

Born in India with yoga theoretically in my spiritual blood, I was having a hard time appreciating yoga when I went to the many studios in Philadelphia and Los Angeles during my 16 years in this great country. My fiancé stumbled on to Yogaraj because it was close to where we live and I hesitatingly joined her as she packed her yoga mat to attend a class one Thursday evening. My fiancé had tried other classes at Yogaraj before and had liked it. The owner, Jay Co, met me at the front with a smile and introduced us to our yoga instructor - Christine West. Wow was I blown away. I haven't attended any other class at Yogaraj because Christine needs to be my weekly yoga instructor until the day I leave Los Angeles or go to the other side. She is stupendous. So easy to understand and so rhythmic with her flow. She truly made me love and appreciate yoga. She made me connect with a practice I so wanted to become a part of me. I do not miss classes - I go every Thursday or Sunday when Christine teaches. She is so attentive, and is so patient with my many faults that you cannot go wrong attending her class if you are a beginner. I already feel my practice is stronger and I am way more flexible than I ever was. Jay Co continues to greet me at the door and give me a friendly handshake - what a great owner running a great business. You can't beat their prices too - $10 for a class. Trust me, West LA, you cannot go wrong attending a class here. I won't go to any other instructor that is not Christine but I am sure the others that teach here are equally proficient. Go Yogaraj!",4QGDiGgL2u78wvyUaNkcKA,Govind M.,90025

I bought a Groupon for 8 classes and couldn't wait to get started, only to find out that the number of weekly beginners classes is extremely limited. Unless you can go to a 6:00 or 7:00 am or 7:30 or 9:30 pm class during the week, you are out of luck. There are NO classes during the day or on weekends. Since the class size is limited, every time I tried to sign up for one of the classes I was put on the waiting list, usually in 6th or 7th place, so needless to say, I only made it to one class, when Sue called to let me know a space had opened up. Sue told me to be there 15 minutes early so she could orient me and fit me with weights, but she arrived 15 minutes late herself. So I was at a huge disadvantage to begin with, floundering around in the water with no idea what to do. The class is held in a small pool, next to a large pool of classes where the coach is constantly yelling to the class and the sound echoes throughout the facility, making it almost impossible to hear Sue's instructions. I think the idea and concept behind this class is fantastic, but it needs to be held in a different facility, with more options for classes and a more conducive environment for this type of exercise. It just doesn't work. Incidentally, when I sent Sue an email expressing my disappointment and asking for a partial refund, she never bothered to reply.",2FxQBHD6KMMii52SBYXLPA,Jane H.,90036

Dance Studio Rentals",1709 Stewart St,3.5,"Performing Arts,Dance Schools,Dance Studios",Westside School of Ballet,44,2,,2/7/2015,"The adult ballet class has a wonderful teacher (Joan Baley) and she definitely knew what she was talking about and had helpful notes on body placement when it came up. She is the reason for the two stars. The main problem was the size of the class (at least 30 people filling every square inch of barre space) and the lack of instruction for what we were doing. It felt very robotic and not an open or inviting learning environment. It's probably a fantastic place for a well seasoned dancer who did ballet previously, where not much explanation is needed for anything. But for someone who didn't have that, an injury could happen very fast just from not knowing what you're doing! It's a class for beginners, I don't know why safety wouldn't be first. Lastly, the fellow dancers in the class are not friendly nor do they put any effort into trying to be friendly. They're quite rude and have an arrogance about them (don't expect to find friends or community here). Yes, that is kind of the nature of ballet, but in all honesty people, none of you are going to be professional ballerinas, so ditch the diva act. It makes for a stuffy and stale atmosphere. I like to enjoy ballet, not just get through it. I'll be going elsewhere unfortunately. ",MZ97TejuG5kx0QQYHeuA9A,Lia V.,90404

I've worn pointe shoes at the barre of many technique classes and have never had technique reworked for me- somehow, I managed just fine. I really disliked that attitude (and being called ""pointe girl"" thereafter), especially since I'd asked the front desk and they said wearing pointes would be fine. The studio doesn't offer pointe classes for adults so if one doesn't take technique on pointe, are they simply supposed to quit dancing on pointe even if they've been doing so for many years?

I hear they are redoing it this summer though - hopefully they add another 2 floors to accomodate all the people in the Santa Monica area that come here.

I'm here for the classes and don't want to hang out at the gym for more than an hour after a long day of work. I was excited about the renovation. But its packed to begin with and now that it's been closed for so long...it's only going to get busier when it opens! I don't want to feel like I'm going to a club everyday just for a workout. And that's what it feels like when I'm there because there's a wait for everything and it's overcrowded. I've been shopping other gyms like equinox and crunch. Yes they are more expensive but you get what you pay for. Not sure what they will do about the parking situation. Why pay 0.25 cents every time ? I would like to have that included in my monthly dues or something. I don't carry change and if I do it's for parking meters. Looking into joining another gym!",zTznojwXCfCNwJ2vIR307Q,MJ O.,90405

Put on some clothes lady. No one wants to see it. Plus, the girl's restroom only have 4 stalls and is always dirty, smelly, and gross. They need to hire more maintenance workers.

I used to go to the West Hollywood location and then switched to this one when I moved to the west side. They are both equally disgusting and poorly run. The state of the entire gym was deplorably dirty. The bathrooms in the womens locker room were absolutely foul. I doubt they were even cleaned once a day... they always smelled awful, ran out of toilet paper, and had muddy footsteps all over the floors. I honestly thought I was going to catch a disease from using the equipment and forget doing any floor excercises... I doubt their floors have been swept or mopped since the location opened. The staff was okay on the whole. Some people were relatively friendly but others treated you like you were somehow inconveniencing them if you asked a question or tried to purchase something.

The first thing I noticed was the gym was packed...like day-after-Thanksgiving-at-the-mall packed. The location made a lot of upgrades...new layout, floor, wall coverings, machines, etc. The layout was kind of confusing at first. I noticed that the main cardio room doesn't have AC?? They installed ceiling fans. It was boiling in there and it already stunk and this is after one week?! They upgraded and added several cardio machines. It still didn't matter; I had to wait about 10 minutes before being able to jump on an elliptical machine. The weight room has all brand new, well, everything and the layout is better although again it was very, very busy. I estimate about 200+ people were in the gym all together. It was obviously much cleaner than before the renovation but again they only been open a week or so, so it remains to be seen if they can keep it up.

I loved Nikki and Boneshia's spin classes but after months of the ac not working and the ridiculous sign-up system, I decided I was sick of being sick (kept getting colds could not get rid of) and upgraded to Equinox. Yes, it is costlier but the expense is well worth it - I have not been sick nearly as much and I can get into any class I like. FYI 24 Hour - the way we do it at Equinox is you can sign up for a specific bike an hour prior - not a week prior, no knocking people out of the way to get the bike you like, and all of the bikes always work which makes all the difference. Plus, at Equinox, there is a cleaning crew - isn't that amazing? Everything said about the Ocean Park location is true - it is truly dirty. I guess it is fine if you are in college or early 20s, but you reach a point in your life when the gym is about health. Although I definitely do miss Nikki and Boneshia - Equinox would be smart to pick them up and pay them what they deserve (we do have great teachers at Equinox too - I am not knocking them).",9ucybNCgnOjenhcJde9d7g,C B.,90405

They both clearly saw me and waved. I sat back and waited (for a while). Instead of going elsewhere, the supervisor continued talking down to my trainer right in front of me and the manner in which he was doing so was quite off-putting. I don't know what the situation was and having spent time myself in various work environments, I know I cannot judge a situation if I don't know what it was.

They now have free towel service, free lockers with their own locks, and TRX Suspension Training. I think my favorite part about the upgrade has to be the new Hoist weight machines because they move with your entire body as opposed to the one muscle group you are trying to work out. Although i love the improvements I am still disappointed by the cleanliness. The bathrooms have been left a mess on several occasions and sometimes there is no soap which just disgusts me. This will definitely be my 24 hour fitness of choice, I just hope they improve the cleanliness issue soon because this place has 5 star potential.",DfQhz_ZDstGrgpWGw0nX9A,Rachel F.,90405

I had a feeling I couldn't trust putting it in the locker in the women's locker room, but I stupidly trusted humanity and did it. After only a 30 minute workout I came back to find no purse inside my locker. Those working at the front desk were extremely unhelpful when I asked about my lost purse. I looked in the lost and found basket after speaking to them and nothing was there. One woman at the fronst desk said she'd look around, and that I should ""come back to the front desk if i don't find anything"" in a few minutes. I went back to the lockers and continued to look, then headed back to front desk, at which point I saw my black purse sitting on top of the lost and found basket!!! when i walked over to get it, the two women loudly reprimanded me and put their arms up ""you can't be back here, employees only!"" i said ""sorry, i just see my purse here"" and so she handed me my bag with no wallet inside. My wallet was large and you couldn't miss it, and I asked one of the girls working ""do you know who put this in the lost and found just now?"" she replied that SHE had found it in the women's locker room, and when i asked about the red wallet she responded EXTREMELY defensively, saying she wouldn't know what was in it, she only brought it to the front. After that, I sensed a very suspicious situation going on and I just knew that one of the workers had taken it. Neither of the women said ""oh, we're sorry that happened"" or anything of that nature, only ""we can't help with that. we know nothing."" She wouldn't even look me in the eye when she handed me the purse. When i asked if I could see insider the drawers surrounding the basket, the woman refused. She wouldn't let me check to confirm that one of them hadn't stuffed it into the drawers. And Finally, they wouldn't even give me a free pass for validation when I left in tears because my entrance card was IN my wallet, so I had to deal with that just trying to get out of the place.

There is one RPM instructor who is terrific, but she only teaches once a week at 9:30AM, and I can never make her other two 8AM classes.  The other cycling instructors are shockingly abysmal and I would love to know what qualifications this gym requires for their cycling instructors.  I was stunned when I walked into a class with an instructor who is not only obese, but unable to do much on the bike at all.  She gives barely any instruction, save telling you every ten minutes to turn up your level a few notches -- which, of course, she isn't doing herself.  Is it not a requirement for a fitness instructor to be at least somewhat fit? There is also a cycling instructor who is pregnant, doesn't get on the bike, and puts no energy into her instruction. Oh -- I have to add -  the cycling room is never cleaned between cycling classes.  Truly disgusting.  There is an instructor who demanded we not only clean up our bikes after class, but the floor as well.  Is the gym paying me to clean the floors?  ",muta72339SBM8mvIHhV3NA,C A.,90405

When I went to the Westchester location, this lovely man named Wolfgang greeted me (when I wondered if I should STAY) but then when I tried to cancel with this guy (Marcus?) He ACTUALLY said to me when I told him I wanted to cancel and i explained why, ""Are you sure that's a good idea? Should a child really be working out at that age when their muscles aren't fully developed?""  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  First of all, he sounded like an idiot, secondly, it was NONE of his business, and most importantly, it was IRRELEVANT!  I was there to cancel.  Done, End of Story.  So I called the Santa Monica location, (LIVID) and asked for a supervisor.  Luckily, the man who answered was the one who signed me up and said he would cancel me over the phone.  Really?  Fancy THAT!  Over the phone, after I was told I would need to go in (which I arranged for a sitter so she wouldn't have to drive with me across town and sit in the lobby for paperwork) BAD customer service.  The gym is great for young single people who like a nightclub atmosphere BUT NOT FOR FAMILIES in my honest opinion.  UGGGH.",FTu_0oL1kObN0QQH-aMsAw,Liz A.,90405

Walking upstairs to the second floor Theres a stench. I know gyms are generally going to smell bad but most 24's don't smell like this, especially if it is considered a super-sport. I figured it could be bad ventilation. The gym equipment works well and seems new and durable. I feel the layout is a bit scattered with additional treadmills in the kettle-ball room. The locker rooms were basic and clean. However one of the negatives would be some of the unhygienic gym members this gym attracts. A heavy set man squatting and having the people around him smell his unclean backend that he obviously does not clean is a horrible experience no one should go through. It was horrid. So if you're around Santa Monica and this seems to be your only option for a workout. Keep your nose plugged and breathe through your mouth? I guess.",10V8fjn--RrO0qDL35n8Dw,Casey P.,90405

After reviewing different options, he told me about the discount offer available through Costco which offered a great savings. I told him that i had spoken to them but they said this level club was not part of their offer. He called them while I was there to confirm that this type of prepaid membership was available and got the price for me as well(requires a Costco membership also.) He then arranged a guest workout pass so that I would have club access for a few days before I went to Costco to purchase a prepaid membership.

Another issue is that it is very dirty, not only the club itself, including showers, pool and so on. THE AIR! When you work out you breath in dusty air. How do I know that? I come to the club, work out and when I am done I go and use toning cleanser on my face and the cotton pad is always so dusty after I wipe my face with it.

This morning there was the most atrocious sight in the girls locker room. Aside from the layer of dirt, towels Everywhere, garbage can that was seperated from the garbage can cover...and no cleaning crew in sight... I almost threw up this morning when I noticed the same two used towels sitting on the bench by where I was working. I went to move them because it was clear that an hour after my workout no one was using these towels as I went to pick them up a mound of SKIN and a broken razor fell to the floor. APPALLING it was as if there was someone in their razoring the dead skin off of their heels. And the broken razor head was on the floor under the bench.. the grip part under the towels. So utterly disgusting. It just gets worse and worse. Only cleaning crew was one guy vaccuuming upstairs. I really just need to change gyms at this point.

I do have a schedule that does not fall into the typical 9-5 hours so I am able to go when the gym isn't as impacted. I love the variety of equipment that they have here, which include cardio machines, rowing machine, battle ropes, free weights, and weight machines. I recently started swimming here, and was turned off by the male cleaning that decided that it was okay to scrub down the floors and hose it down into the pool as guests were swimming! It was also past 11am, which happens to be the time when the pool reopens from cleaning on Tuesdays. He definitely walked in after 11am to begin scrubbing the floors. I agree that circulation is poor, as another yelper suggested, if I'm in the main cardio area it always seems to be hot and stuffy! The staff always greets me when I walk in and there are always towels available upon entering the gym. I've never had an issue with disinfectant being available, but there are other guests that decide to leave their trash lying around.

"Most Dojos fall under one of two categories: fight clubs or day care. The School of Martial Arts is different. We offer offer a third choice: Real Martial Arts, taught well.  We successfully strike a balance between tradition and a modern, scientific approach to self-defense.

Many schools say they train the mind as well as the body, but actually finding Mindfulness in practice is unfortunately very rare. Our students gain both mental and physical discipline. After just a few classes, you will see the difference in quality between our school and others. After just a few months, you'll see a difference in the quality of your life!

Not only is it a great physical workout (there hasn't been a class yet when I don't leave dripping in sweat!) but it is a mental and spiritual workout as well. Sifu Ryan Scott really believes in the zen philosophy not only in marital arts, but in life. Practicing martial arts at this dojo has helped me implement mindfulness into my life. Martial arts is all about appreciating the present moment exactly for what it is. Mindfulness is a skill, and I'm thankful that I get to practice it at every class here and then be able to implement it in my life and work. Everybody here is friendly, supportive, and has a desire to learn and grow. It's not about ego or competition here. Martial arts is indeed an ART, and like any art, achieving a specific outcome will never bring happiness until you learn to love the process...and this school has definitely empowered me to do so.",fI6uXv_D_pS4A00h6Y22gw,H L.,90025

Last year I finally started taking lessons so that I can start playing with some coworkers. When I start something, I go all in. I started with lessons from a local pro at a driving range, signed up for lessons at GolfTec, and even took some one off lessons from the deal sites. I got every book, course, training aid available and majority of my free time was spent on watching and reading tips and tricks and reviews all over the web. However, despite the time, money and effort I was devoting to improving my game, my progress was slow. Everything made sense intellectually, but I could not get my body to do what all of the things that the tips and lessons were telling me to do. My search for a more high tech and more qualified teacher led me to Urban Golf Performance. I came in for a free tour and I was first impressed with the awesome setup. Trackman, simulators, SAM Puttlab, pressure sensors, video, and more. All of the newest tech that the pros use! Then I was given a quick swing evaluation. With just a few swings, Mac was able to identify all of the issues that I was struggling with and finally gave me some real INSTRUCTION, that I never got anywhere else. Since I started taking lessons here, I have made real lasting progress. All of the instructors here are top notch with not only the credentials but skills to prove it. I am amazed how effortless they make it seem and that somehow, they are able to magically impart some of that skill on to me! Anyone that is serious about improving their game owes it to themselves to come take at least one lesson to see for yourself that you need to take lessons from a real professional. Stop wasting time and money on useless gimmicks, marketing, and ""tips"" and find out how to really improve. You'll be glad you did.",R25GliqDWO2orffkfuFaHQ,Jonny L.,90064

This is a long overdue review but I have nothing but the BEST things to say about Dr. Dadvand and the entire team at Dadvand Chiropractic! I first came in in January with chronic lower and upper back pain. I had literally gone to different chiropractors in every city for the past 8 years and had no luck with a steady form of treatment for my issues. The doctor recommended me to start getting massages prior to my adjustments. It made a world of difference. He also suggested that I try using my insurance (though it has never worked before) and it worked! I can finally get the treatment I need and after 6 weeks, I am literally a new person. I am in so much less pain and have been able to become much more fit and active as a result. Also, he is very accommodating to schedules and overall is the best chiropractor I've been to!!

I called Dr. Dadvand and let him know what the insurance company said. His reply was simply that my insurance company did not pay him enough and he said having me come in to his office was a ""waste of time and money"". He was VERY rude. I let him know that this is a problem between him and my insurance company and that he should speak with them directly. He told me to go to someone other place that was in network because he won't get paid enough by my insurance. I have gone to two other physical therapy offices using this insurance and have never had this issue. I have never been so disappointed and mistreated by a medical professional. Dr. Dadvand only cares about money--I would skip out on this office and go somewhere that actually cares about quality care and professionalism with their patients.

Neither of us have any experience with silk acrobats, but I watched a video on Youtube and figured it would be chill. We selected Ivanna based on the assumption that someone with a name like that had to be the impressive. And she was! Aerial silk was her expertise, so she took us in and proved it. My abs are still killing me. This was an extremely difficult class that required a lot of flexibility, strength and focus. I sobered up quick from last night's hangover during the foot lock climbs. I wish that she took five minutes at the end of class to show us a little routine of her own (not that we were in any shape to follow an entire routine) but it would have been nice to see what she could do with all of the movements, grips and locks she had taught us.",i4XhIHW7ijjy4IT9QmR2NQ,Nicole R.,90401

Flying in the air with a beautiful ocean view, who could refuse? And it was around April when the weather was warming up that a friend and I decided to take a chance and take a class. I can't recall all of my instructors names except Morning Star. She was as unique as her name and really helped me through the process. They start you off by giving you a demonstration of your body motions on the ground then it's as fast as put chalk on your hands, climb up the narrow ladder and get strapped on for the jump! When your on top, your supposed to lean you body over the edge while the instructor is holding the harness and as soon as they say ""HEP"" (International word for ""go"") you are supposed to jump off and swing over and eventually wrap your legs over the bar and hang by nothing but you feet (like a monkey haha) It sounds scary and it IS! I really recommend not to listen to your instincts when your on top because my body kept pushing back  and away which prevented me from jumping when they said HEP. Just don't think because once you jump you get such a beautiful and freeing feeling (of course the adrenaline def helps :) ) And honestly it's all safe, there's a harness strapped around you and a net on the bottom that will always catch you once you fall. After an hour and half of practicing our jumps the last two tries we had to attempt to be caught by an instructor on a bar on the other end! This time you can't take your time on jumping off, once you hear HEP you have to jump because someone one the other end is waiting for you. I only got one try at it and instincts kicked in and as soon as I heard the word I jumped, wrapped my legs over the bar and held out my hands and what do you know was caught by the instructor! My legs let go of the bar and I was swinging only by the instructors hold on me... It was such a jovial feeling! ",u-5_7PN34St-RU9LnkZslw,J P.,90401

Our class had 8. I had read the email thoroughly before arriving and knew to wear yoga pants and socks.  Right when we arrived, we were putting on a harness and already learning.  After doing a couple practice ""jumps"" on the ground, next thing you know- we are climbing the ladder.  Not gonna lie- climbing the ladder was the scariest part.  But once you grab that bar with both hands and jump off the platform- it is exhilarating.  One of the instructors is yelling out commands and as long as you follow- then its a breeze.  I have weak arms and weak abs and was worried that would be a problem, but I let momentum propel me and I was able to do the tricks with ease. The 2 hours go by fast and by the end of the lesson, I did a successful ""catch and release"". ",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,Rosemarie Y.,90401

They make it very easy to sign up for classes online and prepare you well ahead of time. The instructors are all great and run the class very efficiently. I was very pleasantly surprised at how quickly they advance you through the tricks. Everything was very safe and I felt well supported. Although it's a little pricey, there are quite a few deals if you buy multiple classes together. Also, it gets pretty busy in this area on the weekends so definitely give yourself enough time to find parking and walk through the throngs of people on the pier. There is cheap parking on Colorado and 2nd in the structure. ",gggWd4tfuVdjSYxYFOectw,Aliyah K.,90401

So I figured it would be best to do a free trial membership. I had the hardest time getting this from the Santa Monica 24 hour gym. On a weekday, I called asking to speak to someone about it. The employee who answered my first call at around 10am, Chris, told me someone would be calling me by close of business to set me up. I called again at 4pm and the same person answered.  He said he couldn't remember,  and so I proceeded to ask for a manager, after which he coincidentally remembered me. He passed the phone to someone else (I'll call him Guy2)- not a manager- who told me that somone would call me within the hour. As you can guess, 1.5 hr later I called and spoke to Guy2 again who told me that the person he gave the message to decided he would go home early. A little courtesy call would have been nice. But wait, it gets better. A manager calls me a week later saying she saw a note that I was a nearby resident interested in their gym. After retelling the story, she apologized BUT proceeeded to tell me That SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED because communication at the front has always been a problem, and she's received the same complaints before. What?! If it's a problem, why has it not been adequately addressed?  Needless to say I put my complaints to corporate, and enjoy another gym. Be weary.  I figured these were the shenanigans I had to deal with and I wasn't even a member yet.

I've gone to many 24 hour fitnesses in many different cities and for some reason I have to wait to talk to someone first before I exercise. Why pay for a gym membership if you can't use the gym? Waiting and being ignored for over 15min is rude and poor customer service. I don't mind spending a little more for the super sport membership, but I waited 20min without even getting an opportunity to upgrade or discuss an upgrade for that matter. I drove out of my way to exercise and enjoy the spa, but it was closed. When I asked the lady behind the counter if I could just exercise for one day (since the amenities that made it a super sport were inaccessible) I was told I'd have to wait to talk to someone. No one came and I got tired of waiting. FYI, the gym I go to is dark, a little run down and even with validation you still have to pay 1.70 for up to 3 hours.

He asked me for some info, told me the rates and that was it. About 35 bucks a month for no contract, 25 a month for one year and 15 a month for 2 years. No pressure at all. And that's one of the reasons why I want to join this gym now, because I have been to many gyms where they take down a ton of personal info, take me on a bs tour of the facilities, then give me a long sales pitch and claim that if I don't sign up now they can't waive the initiation fee or some other gimmick.

We initially met with Melanie to get to know one another, and even though we'd talked to other Doulas, we instantly knew she was the one. In the meeting she was open and receptive of our views, patient, encouraging and knowledgeable; all of which continued throughout the process. We meet a few times in person prior to the birth, a check up of sorts where we bonded as a unit - this proved to be invaluable once L&D was in full effect. She also provided advice on exercise, breathing and focus techniques. 2 weeks prior to our due date Melanie and I communicated frequently, she answered our questions and helped to put us (me) at ease - of course, I was a week late and I began to get even more nervous.... then the day finally came and contractions started in the middle of the night, you think I'd know I was in labor but still through the pain I was so confused, was I in labor or not??? Melanie to the rescue - she reminded us that this was all normal and part of the process. I labored at home as much as I could, she came over to assist once I was fully on - my husband and I felt at ease that we had someone on our side, without her we probably would have ran to the hospital at first sign of a contraction..I arrived at the hospital at 7 centimeters.. I don't know how I did it but I did.. Once it was time, it was Melanie's time to shine - she was absolutely amazing always attentive and caring, she helped to keep me focused and encouraged me when I doubted myself. It was a long labor, we were all tired but she stayed to make sure he latched. Our last in-person meeting a few days post partum was emotional and seeing her again concluded what I now consider a beautiful chapter in my life.

Nobody ever really knows how things will pan out during labor, and it was nice to know we had someone fully educated about all our options that didn't work for the hospital or our doctor. We gave birth in a hospital (not birthing center) so having a good balance between that of western minded medicine in a hospital and our Doula who was educated on the holistic scope of labor was a good balance for us. Melanie visited with us a few times in the months leading up to our birth and gave us some thorough information really trying to get a sense of what our needs were and was helpful in getting us prepared for what was to come.

The customer service is so bad. It's like all of the employees would rather hangout with each other than actually manage a gym. Today the fire alarm went off and huge amounts of dusts a debris were being dumped into the downstairs work-out area. They were dismissively saying, ""everything's fine, go back to what you were doing"". Instead of telling the guests the truth, they said it was a ""test alarm"". I looked into the laundry room and saw huge amounts of dusts from the machines being pumped into the aircon system which is why the alarm went off. I went back to the downstairs area to work out but the whole room was filled with dust and other particulates - not safe to work out in. There have been several other issues over the years and the staff continues to mismanage things. I keep my head down when I go to the gym and just try and get through there without any issues. I'll give them a 2 because how cheap they are compared to other options in the area. Even compared to 24's other super-sport gyms (like in Long Beach) -  this one is a mess. I'm leaving this gym soon and there is nothing I'll miss.",i7gzpFY7-s7ZIiB4yxtTCQ,Jessica H.,90405

So since we got a great deal, I couldn't pass it up. I've visited twice and I already feel at-home here. Even more so, than when I was a member at LA Fitness. I love that everyone minds their own business and there are weights available and not scattered everywhere. The machines are MUCH MORE ergonomically correct. I don't have to wait for a machine and our parking gets validated for 2 hours. I don't want to get too excited since this is only my second visit, but so far, I am happy. The only complaint that I have -which is a very important one, I wish the custodians would refill/check on the sanitation spray every hour. Since this IS a 24 hr gym, the flow of traffic is heavy which means there should be top of the line surveillance on every room.

I'm a competent athlete, with a lifetime of sports and lifting although I am now in my mid 50's and have intermittent low back pain. I relayed all of that to the membership and training staff as I was looking for a gym for a month while visiting the area, and a trainer competent in functional training. I was referred to a particular trainer as a good fit for me. the gym itself was very, very crowded even at 'slow' times, as in; waiting for machines in weight rooms, little room to perform body weight exercises, the tiny functional training area had a person on every single station, crowded and sweaty (humid) cardio areas. I noticed this but thought it was manageable. first work out with the trainer; she was excited because I am strong and trained me hard despite my explanation of low back concerns. I went home and was immediately sick with fever and nausea for 24 hours. next workout, my back was more sensitive which I explained to the trainer, she said 'ok, I'll modify what I had planned,' we started with jumping battle ropes. I had never done battle ropes let alone jumping and didn't know to say absolutely not. on the second set my back spasmed, I could walk so she was moving me to the next exercise. then we tried things that would isolate the muscles, ie not use the back. have you ever tried to not use your back while lifting weights? not possible. I told her that we needed to stop. as a result I'm still going to physical therapy and had one doctor's (ortho) appointment with xrays. any trainer or PT I've discussed this with is appalled a trainer would know SO LITTLE as to ask a client with back trouble to do battle ropes and a lawsuit wasn't out of the question. an after the fact look at the trainer's bios posted on the wall; all but one has minimal experience with only one certification and earned this year 2017. on top of the very low level of experience of the training staff, the lack of cleanliness is really hard to believe. small mountain (literally) of empty plastic water bottles and large dust bunnies in the basketball court while doing planks, dirty mats.... no point going further, it was the filthiest place let alone gym I've been in a long time excepting India. A building crammed full of exhaling people needs air circulation but there were no opening windows that I could see. if you've read this far, you can see that the owners are laughing all the way to the bank and have NO concern for their clients' health or wellness. in short, it's a disgusting dirty and unsafe place to train. On the other hand, the 24 hr fitness on 4th st I think it is, has a full time cleaning staff and is a clean place to work out with many fewer people at one time. I didn't try their trainers and can't comment.",Yg4LvAQLYyiibwFHR8GuHw,Carol R.,90405

The exercise machines are often broken and, most egregiously, the management pays no attention to entreaties by the members (verbal and written) to improve things.  Also, at most other gyms, towels and disinfectant are strategically  placed throughout the gym.  It's a not so subtle reminder that we should be mindful of wiping off the machines when we use them.  A virtuous cycle results causing people to be respectful and hygienic.

While most of the staff was friendly the Manager who signed me up his name was Robert kept me waiting for more than 30 minutes while he chatted away with another coworker in his office. At first I thought maybe he's not the one who signs me up so I kept waiting. When he came to offer his ""HELP"" i was not too pleased. We still proceeded to sign me up and while he was talking he gave me this excuse that he was on the phone with a customer and no one had told him I was waiting. I couldn't believe that he actually lied about that. I was standing right in front of his office and noticed him talking to another coworker not really doing anything. After I finished signing up I asked him if he was on break or something, and he told me he was and that he clocked back in as soon as he heard someone needed help. That pretty much got me very angry because not only does he lie about being on break but just  a few moments ago he lied about being on the phone with another customer when in fact I saw him inside the office with the door open (open door policy or something) talking to another coworker like he was off the clock while still in full uniform. I've seen other staff coming back from lunch wearing a jacket or not on their uniforms because anyone who has worked in retail knows you don't wear your uniform on the floor if you're on break.

We asked if we could at least see the facility before committing. She said we weren't even allowed to see it -- not just a free guest pass, but we weren't even allowed to see the facility before committing to 40 per month. She became extremely rude and combative, to the point where we asked for her name, which she refused to give. She also told us that this location was a Super Sport facility.

The parking situation is embarrassing for the company. They don't own the lot so they use a third party to run their parking. Like a lot of regulars sometimes it takes a little over 2 joe by the time you park and stretch, get in the workout and cool down. They charge 2 bucks every 15 minutes to park. They also make you carry around a a validation card which no doubt gets lost more than they will admit. If you lose it it costs 20 bucks to just get out of the lot. I think it's embarrassing for them to not include Parking for free. Guests should not have to pay 20 dollars to park to go to their gym.

I recently visited this gym a few days ago while leaving work. Within 10 mins I was disgusted with this gym!!! I proceeded my way to the elliptical and started working out, after I put my phone in the machine's phone socket. Within minutes my phone music went off. I grab my phone out the machine phone socket and to my surprised their was WATER dripping from my phone!!! Apparently another gym member pour water in the holder for your phone. I went to the front desk and explained what happen. The night manager was totally surprise to see and observed the machine and my phone and wrote the information down for the GM to see it the next day. Because 24 Hour Fitness damaged my phone, my fiance called the gym for me and was advised by GREG the General Manager that I signed a contact stating that 24 Hour Fitness isn't responsible for any property. Therefore I am out a phone and have to pay for another phone due to 24 Hour Fitness not cleaning their machines properly, and blaming customers for their mistake!!!! So basically 24 Hour Fitness doesn't provide CUSTOMER SATISFACTION!!!! They would rather lose $60 a month  (my husband and I) then to pay $200 for a customer's phone that was damaged at their facility!!! Why I am the one that has lost out on money and a new phone????? The machines here are horrible, the cleanliness of the facility is horrible. The customer service is good, but provided a good customer experience, and satisfaction doesn't exist!! I will be contacting the BBB in regards to my experience and request for satisfaction to my concern. I will be also be making is known on all social media and my friends. Wasting my time at the this gym was the worst gym experience EVER!!! The fact that 24 hour fitness doesn't want to budge on their contacts and treat customer's like crap is sad, and disappointing!!!!

This particular location holds an infectious demeanor in regards of its appearance. A gym typically exists for individuals to make a conscious effort in taking care of themselves to the fullest; people sign up and pay for gym memberships to have a place to tune-in, work out and clean up, right? A gym should be organized, structured and up-kept in order to provide a space to do the same for your self. How are you going to pop into a gym and attempt to keep healthy when the gym itself doesn't offer the same? For some, a gym is simply a place to pump some iron and build muscle mass, but for many it provides a home away from home and should be a place you feel encouraged to visit because of its ambiance, and overall energy. This simply doesn't apply here. It feels hollow. It feels like there isn't any one in charge and a ""they didn't clean up, why should I?"" Type of vibe. Employees bunch up at the front desk taking turns folding towels, but that's pretty much it. Where is the maintenance? Where are managers enforcing some sort of standards that should be met? Where is the sort of employees/management that greet you with a warm energy leading you to feeling good about spending money to be a part of this ""club""?

The instructors have all been great for the most part. But 30% of the time I go to this gym they have to deal with the stereo - that should be embarrassing. It wastes everyone's time, it diminishes the the workout, it eats into the time of the work out it frustrates the attendees and the instructor. Any half decent gym should have a stereo that can handle volume, bass and a jumping class. Please upgrade the system or make it digital. ANYTHING. This needs to be improved and is ridiculous - it is one simple fixed cost to update. We are not in the 90s where skipping CDs in are OK",RV6nnWYp1n1TvbjtHE56Fw,Lara D.,90405

This place needs a good scrub and disinfecting but can say it if you have to workout its better then most LA fitness spots but would never want this to be my main workout spot. How can they call this a SuperSport???maybe because it has a half court basketball area and a mini lap pool?? so if your into mini things you're good to go!!

A clear sign that a new system is needed if you're interested members having a quality experience. One alternative might be to have a team member go around with tags at ""rush"" hours to see which machines are not being used and/or asking members currently exercising if they encountered a bad machine.

The machines are completely in need of repair or replacement, you will often find them 'out of order' or just squeaky and old. I found out while talking with an employee that they have only ONE person who works in the repair department for ALL of the 24 hour fitness' in the Los Angeles area.

The front desk lady, Mikhel (spelling) had the worst attitude and horrible customer service. I had called earlier to update my dads member ship, so when we checked in she stopped us. I tried to explain the situation to her, she then put her hand in my face saying ""I am not talking to you."" I was trying to explain to her that I was the one that spoke on the phone and know what's going on and to look at the notes on his membership. She kept cutting me off, putting her hands in my face. After the fact, we went to grab my cousin from the sauna and on the way back, Mikel shoves into me and pushes me and exclaims ""EXCUSE ME!"" So we promptly asked for the manager as she harassed me. As we spoke with the manager who's name I believe was Miguel, she kept looking over and smirking at us. He said he was the fitness manager, but could grab the general manager for us to speak with. We then spoke with Michael Tuesca, he was great at hearing us out and our concerns. Need I mention we waited 30 minutes to talk to him, and almost missed our cycling class. Michael helped to calm me down, but I am so livid with the customer service here. I am a paying customer and do not deserve to be treated the way I did. I will be reaching out to corporate as I feel harassed and will not be returning to this facility. Also, the sauna smells really bad. Mikel, please learn some proper customer service etiquette and not take your emotions out on a random person. Rude service. Poor cleanliness. Never returning.

It's all about dissociation so suck up and take care of yourself. For me the free weight room is poorly organized. I like it best when a room progresses from Legs bench workout to free DB/BB's all accessible and workable.

I have a few issues with this 24 hour fitness. First issue is that it is a ""Super"" 24 hour fitness however, they said they did not have any towels on one particular day. If you have access to Super this means you pay more for membership. All super sport should have towels readily available. One day they said the towels would not be ready for another 20 minutes.. I just started my workout so I said okay and moved on. However, another time (which was mentioned above), they said they did not have any towels on that specific day. After asking the person at the front desk.. they said that they did not have any because they ""rotate"" them out which honestly made no sense to me. I heard another person frustrated as well and he said that this has happened many times. After I went into the woman's locker room, I noticed a LARGE pile of dirty towels. The employee told me the reason there were not towels was because they rotate them out.. so clearly that was not the case. This gym is very busy and numerous amount of business people, students etc who count on the towels to get ready in the morning.. so for there to be no clean towels.. was not acceptable (at the end of the day they ended up coming up with the towels but I think only after many people complained). Another issue with this gym is that it is SO busy which is not the issue but it is very hard to find available equipment or spots to work out in the weight area (never really had this issue at any other 24 hour fitness) however the gym is fairly large so you can probably end up finding a spot eventually but have to really look for it. The locker room seems to be decently clean so no issues with that. Bathroom is fine. Haven't had any issues with space in the locker room when getting ready. A few times it appeared the people in the front desk were not paying attention and anyone could walk through.. this is an issue as there is higher risk for locker break ins, etc. I contacted 24 hour fitness through social media but no response.

Jared simply does not know how to use his hands to release tight or injured muscles and joints. His exercises also aggravated the issues I was seeing him for. After just a couple of weeks of therapy I was in significantly more pain than I had been in when I started.

I've actually switched over from Equinox because LA DanceFit has a monthly unlimited and enough diversity in their classes that in can replace a gym membership.  The teachers are all amazing in both skill and spirit.  There's a good balance between Zumba/other upbeat follow along classes and solid routine classes.  Since I've joined, they have added several new classes and have plans to continue to do so.  I haven't tried everything, but so far my favorites are Wil's Zumba and Hip Hop, Odell's Hip Hop, Ilyse's Dancinerate, Amy's Rockin the House, Jhon's zumba, and Andrea's Dance a GoGo.  In one month I've seen a lot of improvement in my dancing...so basically you'll have a blast and become a better dancer.

Wil-son Williams owns the studio and teaches an awesome zumba class, sometimes with live percussionist grooving right along, and Hip-hop classes that challenge the brain and the body. What separates Wil's classes from a lot of Zumba classes, is that Wil, obviously, is a well trained dancer, so the classes inspire with grace and poise, while your butt gets kicked, whereas  many other zumba classes feel simply like  dance aerobics. The movements feel safe to my joints, and get the endorphins flowing. I am hooked. SERIOUSLY.",xKBXwrHDQP1gvDb56VwP_A,Stephanie L.,90025

My review is for their dance team. They don't know anything about customer service.  I was kicked off the team on the day of the presentation without even a notice before. I went to every rehearsal and on the week of the presentation they scheduled one last one 3 days before with such a short notice I already had an important meeting at the same time. I even emailed the instructor the night before asking if there was any info I should know, he answered that we would try to work on it. Not only it wasn't mentioned the possibility of me being kicked off but also I asked about the wardrobe and he didn't tell me that everybody was going with a red shirt. I was very excited to perform, I even brought props and invited some friends. They tried to be polite about me not performing and promised a full refund on the dance team. They asked me just to sent an email and it would be fine. Little did I know that I would spend a lot of my precious time during the next 3 weeks writing emails trying to get a response. I sent two emails and got one automatic response. When I explained my whole situation again in writing, they said they could only refund $60 out of the $175.00 I paid. Then I received another email saying that I owed them $57 and they could credit $3, very convenient this amount. The last time I talked to the receptionist I had a debit of $25 which somehow according to them multiplied. I'm tired of sending emails insisting the obvious, just deliver what was agreed. This is just a summary of what was my nightmare with the dance team. On top of that I also didn't get a T shirt that was promised, they said there would be 8 rehearsals but there was a 6, the teachers were extremly disorganized with the choreography changing constantly. They offered me a free class as if I would ever return to that place again. If you are thinking of joining their dance team, all I have to say is be prepared if you have any conflicting schedule they just don't care and anything they say after you pay can be changed at any moment without a notice. What a huge headache and disapointment this place was. It takes a lot more to get new clients than to loose loyal ones.",ArUBaM72tkSQCka4-MUAQQ,Mariana D.,90025

This was my first zumba class and I must say it got me a bit hooked to wanna come back and use dancing as a form of exercise. I love that it's walk in and you can come when you want and it's only $15 per class. The only thing I wish is that they'd have a zumba class which was only dance/house music.

It had so many sick new songs and you can tell he really builds musicality into his routines. I had the mistake of going a bit too hard the first 15 min so I didn't pace myself for the rest! Haha.

LA Dancefit is by far the best Zumba studio that I have found in Los Angeles, and I've been to quite a few. The teachers here place an emphasis on having fun like most other Zumba classes, but they also teach technique that has different levels of difficulties to keep the new students and the more advanced students engaged. The workout is one of the best I've had, I'm always drenched with sweat no matter what class I'm taking. I've tried several of the instructors here, and have been going for 5 months now. All are great, and all will give you a different workout, but they focus on different things. La Dancefit is also great about bringing in new teachers and classes, and turning them over if they don't do well.

My only complaint? The student (or was she even one of the students?) who stood less than a foot away from the center of the platform/stage where the instructor was teaching, thereby blocking most other students' view of the instructor's demonstrative instruction. :P To make matters worse, the student was not even doing the same moves as the instructor (read: she was doing her own thing while fully engrossed with her reflection in the mirror), so it is not as though I could at least follow along by watching her instead of the instructor.  It's not really the fault of the studio, but I do wish the instructor or staff would have spoken to the student that was rather disruptive to the flow of the class. After all, if she was not going to be a part of the class, then why not have her positioned in a corner of the room that was not directly obstructing half the class's view of the instructor?

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when the woman who owns the spot comes in the class to work out, the teachers get so serious and not they don't let their true fun personalities shine. They don't add that extra twist to the routine. She doesn't allow any talking which is very strange being that this is a loud upbeat class, it's not meditation or yoga.

As the studio has grown and become more popular, the owners seem more concerned with dollars instead of health and safety. There is no limit to the number of students packed in to the space. For the most popular classes, there is no room to move. The initial instructors have become complacent; at times, doing the exact same two or three moves for an entire song. The most disturbing  concern is the lack of cleaning after a class. After countless sweaty bodies have dripped and drenched, they don't even bother to sweep the floor. There  is hair and pools of sweat through the studio. It's a shame ----- there are a few great instructors with fun classes.",g92-bhtWmWfm4zLGmfrprQ,Touley L.,90025

For someone who's not your typical lunching-lady Brentwood woman, this place is very hard to afford. And even though I've been coming here for a while, their prices just went up recently--which is prompting me to write this review (from $16/class to $18). The classes were already expensive before, but now they're just moving further out of my range of acceptability. I wish the classes were cheaper because I'm honestly obsessed with Jhon's Cardio Hip-Hop class and I want to come more, but ultimately, I have to be very choosey about when I use up my precious expensive remaining classes.",0_o3aW_JTKcqRjhgHeVFpQ,Elise D.,90025

However, this is why I take a class - so that you follow the instructor together with everyone and try to keep up when you want to give up, otherwise I can do this at home by myself!  I think I'll stick to my LA Fitness classes.  I know this is a business and they want to make money by encouraging memberships but they need to have better rates for drop-in people.",vgAUi_X5YGqYzXDGAITBbA,Illiana C.,90025

And I'm so happy I did! I used to dance in high school so I always had the love for dance! They offer follow along classes or choreography, which is my favorite! The instructors are amazing, Radha, Kiari, Apollo and Franki are some of my favorites! I started with 1-2 classes a week and worked my way up to 5-6 in the recent weeks! Thank you LA Dancefit for making me shredded in preparation for my show! I will still continue dancing in my improvement season :) They also offer adult dance team series which I'm super excited to try next year! Check this place out, you won't regret it!

Mystic Journey is a different place - you can practice yoga with cyrstals around and sound bath tuned to 7 chakras.

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use.

Because we are going to be following the guidelines suggested, there will be some big changes to our classes. 

1. Social Distancing - Because this is so important, we won't be using exercise stations. Instead, all attendees will find a designated spot to workout in order to maintain at least 6 feet from anyone else.

2. Masks - Until further notice, everyone must wear a mask to class. No exceptions.

3. Gloves - Though it's not required, our members may choose to wear them or not. I don't necessarily think you should be wearing rubber gloves. Standard workout gloves will be just fine as long as you wash them regularly.

4. Sanitation - I will disinfect everything before class including equipment. I will have shared (community) bands and mats everyone can use or new and packaged bands you can purchase. If you choose to use the community bands and mats then you must disinfect them after use.

The instructor, Matt, plays music and motivates you through every work out. I was quite impressed on how much he made me push myself. It is a very diversified class and I  liked all the other campers, very positive and welcoming vibe from everyone. At the end of the class I was really happy I attended. For this particular class we did rotations in different corners of the room where we worked on different parts of our body. By the end of class I felt like my body got a good overall workout, legs, arms, abs and all. There are also alternatives workouts you can do if something is too hard. For example, I have always had trouble with pushups, I just don't have great upper body strength. Matt showed me a different type of way to do that them that was not too strenuous on my body.

I honestly didn't think this transformation was possible for me, as I'd always been a ""normal/average"" size and considered myself rather healthy. I am so happy I found Mandi because now I'm even healthier and more confident in what I can achieve for myself. She's positive and supportive through the whole process, even when I admit that I cheated on my diet or can't make it to the gym for an entire week.

"Facilitating and guiding massive change through Innovative Breathing Techniques and Transformational Coaching.

Who am I?

I'm a guy who needed to make massive changes in my life in every area you can imagine. I've struggled with all of it: alcoholism and addiction; relationships and sex; anger-management; poor self-esteem and self-worth. I tried every form of self-help and meditation practice available and none of them could quiet my noisy head - until I discovered Breathwork. It incomparably delivers in ways no other meditation practice ever has and it's done nothing less than utterly, completely and permanently change my life and perspective for the better. I guarantee you that you will feel results in your very first session or class. It's undeniable.

What I do.

I facilitate change and transformation in the lives of people from every walk of life. I've become an expert at helping people execute tremendous growth in their physical, mental and emotional states - giving them the tools and inspiration required. I've helped perfect a compassionate and honest approach to interrupting past bad habits and creating new, lasting healthy behavior. How did I do it? By learning and using all of these time-honed methods on myself first. I know all of this works because I was nothing less than a disaster and now I'm not just better - I'm thriving. I want to share all of these wonders with everyone who needs real change in their lives.","Santa Monica, CA 90405",5.0,"Meditation Centers,Counseling,Mental Health",Breathe with Jon Paul - Breathwork,46,5,,2/17/2018,"In the summer of 2016 a friend invited me to try Breathwork with JP. I reluctantly went thinking ""oh another meditation class I can't get into"". That night I had one of the most profound experiences to date. Breathwork with JP is like no other meditative experience. His guidance, his ""realness"" and one's ""active"" participation make the experience unique each time. Some sessions I ""work"" really hard and there is a lot of activity and some sessions are more of a quiet, ""passive"" meditation; regardless, I come out whole and energized with clarity at the end of that hour. My words can't do the experience justice. Each person will experience something different, but all will experience something significantly profound.",7FFern_0ruU3fU20CpXdTw,Pardis B.,90405

His breath works classes are amongst the most transformative of any of the forms of meditation that I have attempted. I've only recently re dedicated myself to practicing meditation, something that I started when I was in my 20s but stop doing for a very long period of time. John Paul's class might've been one of the first I attended when I came back and because of his work I've developed a new passion for it. I can promise if you attend one of his classes you will walk away feeling way different than when you walked in. And the more you do it, the more that you'll feel the inner change.

A friend kept encouraging me to go but I wasn't ready. She told me it would change my life and part of me was terrified of what that would mean. Change is scary! But, I knew change was necessary. I could no longer do what I've always done and was tired of being in the same place. Seeing everyone around me living full lives and feeling stuck in mine. So I started breathing every single week with Jon Paul for the last eight months. Every single week I experienced a huge emotional and physical transformation. I cried, A LOT! wondering if I would ever stop crying and when my life would actually change. The changes were subtle at first. Small things like staying accountable with food, exercise and spending. Then relationships with friends and family shifted and I felt myself creating boundaries where they were needed. Business improved and I moved to a bigger and better location after five years in the same place. I gave myself permission to travel more, explore and feel free of the stories I had told myself for so many years. I feel different! I am different! How I show up for myself and others is different. Breathwork is changing my life and I am so grateful that Jon Paul shares his story, his enthusiasm and his technique every week and changes lives.

She says the most inspiring things and pushes you to push yourself in the 45 min time span. I definitely recommend her classes. Try to bring your own water to save two dollars (ha!).

The only problem is the parking. It's in a very popular spot and parking in the front and back lot is not abundant. But the real problem is the company that runs the parking. They are a bunch of Neanderthals. Not only are they rude but they actually get aggressive! Meanwhile you're the one paying their salary. It's run by a bunch of guys who are mad at the world that they're just parking attendants. There are a couple of exceptions but the manager and others are pathetic.

The gentleman in front of me even turned around to welcome me to class...truly the most gracious place! I cannot say enough about this place. I have read all the negative reviews and even articles published about how this is for the 1%. I have news for you I want to be part of this one percent. I teach kindergarten and don't have a lot of disposable cash but I will find a way to make it to soulcycle at least twice a week. It is much more than a workout...it is a lifestyle.

If you are dedicated to spin you should have your own shoes).  The instructor I had, Angela, was ok but the room was uncomfortable and super hot from so many people (50 or so bikes) and 4 large candles packed in such tight proximity that it's hard to breathe.  Overall, if you are really into spinning there are way better options in Santa Monica and the Westside.  My one and only visit here made me value Revolution Fitness where I go to spin so much more ; )",Xaz_ZN6ZmhkwtU_VKDpBAA,Ben L.,90049

Beautiful bikes and facility. This is the 3rd cycling studio in Brentwood. The only big difference is that they give you 1 or 3lb dumbells to lift when you are cycling. At $25 a class with no bulk discounts it can become pricy, thats why the crowd is mostly middle aged housewives from Brentwood.

Came with a friend for a 7 am class on a Tuesday with Lindsay B. She was very intense and inspirational with LOUD music. The front desk people were friendly. They make it easy to get a water and shoes and just charge your account after. They also let me switch bikes to be closer to my friend, which was really nice. The locker space and bathroom are VERY tiny surprisingly since this is a popular place. Would be nice if there was a bit more space. Of course there is the ridiculous price, the mad rush to sign up for class at 12 pm Monday when they open up, etc. But it's nice to mix it up and be around the energy every once in a while. I walked but parking seemed relatively easy there is a lot with a guy out front and some meters. Try the apartment streets just south as well. Soul cycle can be intimidating your first time. You are trying to figure out how to adjust bike, put feet in, stay on the beat.

Walking in the staff was friendly but not as welcoming, especially towards a first time visitor. The class itself was the most disappointing because I definitely did not feel like I got a great workout despite putting in my best effort. There were moments of lull and silence, leaving you wondering what you should be doing. The instructor did not do a good job of keeping everyone together and synchronized in a way that you would typically in a spin class.

What made the class standout relative to others I've taken was that he used the intonation in his voice rather than volume to motivate everyone. He never used the shrill screaming method to get the room excited, instead he would reinforce strong riders by complimenting them. I was surprised to see just how many names he remembered from the start of class when he walked around introducing himself as people got settled onto their bikes. He made deliberate transitions that made the class flow smoothly from song to song, which WASN'T blaring so loudly that you couldn't hear his instructions, it was at a good level.",Dic0_iIkERdutqElAOvU6w,Gregg M.,90049

It works with the craniosacral fluid and restrictions in the fascia, helping to unwind them and access more energy through a stillness of being.

Sweating bullets in the studio today made me feel so refreshed. For some reason either I never push myself hard enough or just I am really not a big sweater but It was a great sweat today!

The floor gets slippery, and if you're forced to move off the mat, you are planting your feet in a slippery puddle of other peoples sweat. Most people understandably prefer to keep their feet on their own mats and towels to avoid the sweat puddles that others have left. However, some old fashioned studios still force you off the mat and into the puddles during triangle pose, but almost all at least let you move your towel under your feet. Today, I've never been so harassed during class to stick my feet in the sweat puddles during triangle pose. I refused and moved my towel to avoid the sweat puddles. Most Bikram studios turn the mats now or have people move to the top of the mat and do a quarter turn. If we don't need mats for triangle, why use them for every other pose? Why does the instructor tell us to use the towel for rabbit pose or spinal twist to get a better grip? Why do we all bring mats and towels just to avoid them during triangle? It doesn't make sense plus it's just gross to stick your feet in people's sweat puddles. As I was leaving the studio, this teacher confronted me about it and continued to harass me. I told her this is my practice, and I don't want to talk to her anymore. She was actually yelling at me as I was leaving the studio. I could hear her from the parking lot. That's not very yoga like if you ask me. ",tcChZ8y_Swhp33OWBHA4xA,Em D.,90292

Last week I signed up for the 30 day pass. My 3rd class with Kari was a real disappointment.  We were at the toe stand pose (padangustasana) and Kari kept saying ""don't bend your leg"" again and again. I was bewildered, wondering  how is it possible to do toe stand pose without bending my leg? (If you look at a diagram of this pose in google images you will know what I mean.) Only one other person was doing the pose who was in a fully seated position so I had no visual reference about what it SHOULD look like to properly get into the posture and Kari didn't show me. She just kept saying the same thing over and over again - don't bend your leg, don't bend your leg... I was doing my best - one of the only 2 people still trying - but evidently doing it all wrong but I had no idea what she meant! When this happens, an instructor needs to try to explain things a different way or SHOW me what she means. Continuing to say the same thing over and over again is not helpful! Especially when the instruction given (straighten your leg) isn't even making sense to me in the context of the pose. If I knew what she was talking about, I would already be doing it! I felt very frustrated and embarressed by the whole thing. After this, I no longer felt good about things so I left class and do not intend to come back. I made a good faith effort to attend classes and do my best and follow instruction but have lost confidence that I would receive high quality instruction there. I have done yoga on and off for 20 years, actively take yoga at Equinox West LA and have had many instructors along the way and none of them have interacted with me this way before. I've had enough experience to know constructive, quality instruction and what I experienced at Bikram Marina Del Rey was definitely not it! I wrote to management the day the incident  happened and attempted to follow-up 3 days later and never received a response. I also tried to get information to be prepared for my first class (ex. are mats provided or do I need to have my own? Bring a padlock? etc.) but no one returned the message I left then either. I gave this organization a good chance but found the customer service  and instruction to be unacceptable. There are so many good yoga places on the Westside. Why put up with it? Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!",QFnVJFf228MBpNpQDW8mDw,Emily M.,90292

When chatting with the instructor after class, she told me, ""Where did you practice before this? Whatever studio it was, you tell them they did a great job. Your practice is beautiful and you're very easy to teach."" That studio that helped me improve my practice so much is none other than Bikram Yoga Marina Del Rey! I practiced at Marina Del Rey for about 3 years-- and I can't express to you how sad I was when I moved out of LA partially because I didn't want to practice bikram at any other studio! Throughout my few years as a member, I had the opportunity of taking classes from numerous instructors. For the most part, they were all great. I especially appreciated their understanding that everyone is at different levels (or may just be having an off day), but they also will correct you or help you with postures so that you get the most out of each class. In particular, I loved OJ and Loren's classes! OJ has such a calming, friendly approach to teaching and Loren has somehow perfected the ability of being strict but hilarious (and will push you!!). The steam room is an added bonus-- at first it was a bit much for me (it can get HOT in that room), but eventually my body got used to it and I thoroughly enjoyed warming up a before class. The only downsides I can speak to are the parking-- especially now that the restaurant stole over half the lot, parking can sometimes be an issue-- and that sometimes the classes can get packed, but that's to be expected when it's a great studio!",iOgVUsbRngdahwTNA0F6-Q,L G.,90292

Came here twice after work with a coworker and really enjoyed the classes I took. It was challenging, hot, and quick- everything i look for in a class. The reason I give it a two star review is because of the inconsistency in the operations of this studio. The person, who I think is the owner, convinced us to do a $50 unlimited month of yoga which we were hesitant at first but since she retroactively allowed us to do it we agreed to her generous offer. I went to class three other times and the door was locked. I went around the building and saw that class was taking place and they had already started. This happened to me 3 times. I don't understand when a class says start time at 9:30am and you are there at 9:25am why has class already started. The door was locked and there was no way to get in. I called several times and it was their general message playing. I left messages and nobody got back to me, ever. I will not be returning to this studio, unfortunately, because they have good classes. However, I cannot waste my time showing up on time to classes and be locked out. Truly a shame because I am a supporter of small businesses especially yoga studios.

In Jeff's 45-minute first appointment with me, he was able to correctly diagnose exactly what the issue was and he knew exactly what to do. I needed to strengthen certain muscles that were not being used, and over the next 4-5 months of exercise, muscle strengthening and treatments by Dr. Tucker, my back issues faded away.

I stopped going to any other studio. The staff is always accommodating and just lovely. And I like that I can choose between a challenging flow-class and a slower, more posture-orientated class. Sometimes I don't feel overly energetic, so I have the choice to take a slower class and still get my workout in. The heat (90-101 degrees) is hot enough to make you sweat without being too hard on your body. It is the perfect detox-temperature. People are unpretentious, not competitive and thankfully no Yoga hipsters. This studio is good for hot yoga beginners and intermediate level yogis. No risk of fainting like in other studios.

If a studio in L.A has parking then they likely validate for 90 mins in a parking lot. I find that 90 mins is never enough time for a 60 min class and I am always trying to rush out so I don't get a charge. My point, the parking here is a huge perk.

I like that I can come to modo and stay mostly inward and get a great work out and sweat. Not that I don't like being social but I appreciate a simplified yoga experience where I can just focus on the practice and not socialize. I prefer the flow classes over the modo classes. I have never been a big fan of the standard 26 pose classes but I mainly come for the heat and I like that modo has taken its own spin off Traditional Bikram. I really don't have any bad things to say about Modo but if I were to make any suggestions I would say add a class style with more upbeat music, unique flows, and lower lighting.

Yes, YogAqua has taken the practice to the sea via a SUP (stand up paddleboard). As a recent Cali (re)transplant who practiced yoga and paddled back home, I was looking for a yoga class where I would feel as though I would be getting the workout I so desired just as I did when I practiced Bikram and PowerFlow back home.  Let me tell you, not only is it a workout to just stay on the board ( kurplunk...I was the first one in the water)but to hold and transition into the poses was challenging as you really had to center yourself and tighten your core throughout the entire session. Sarah was amazing. Her instruction is second to none as she is warm, supportive, patient and really loves what she does. Watching her paddle out and then go into her practice is an art form in itself. Her movements are fluid-like as is her teaching; never rushing from one series to the other, always allowing those of us who seemed to be looking at the bottom of the SUP to get back on and reposition ourselves.

When I first heard about it, I thought about how I struggle just doing yoga on land and that it would be a real challenge to do it on water. Well, its a struggle but it's not like you have to be a yogin to be able to do it. It's a fun challenge that tests your core balance and strength. My first time was in the rain, it wasn't cold but I didn't want to fall in and I didn't!!! The second class was a nice sunny day and I got a little encouragement to go for a handstand(like I can really do them on land). I got onto my hands and then down I went! Best thing about falling in this class is that it's pretty hard to get hurt. I laughed when I read other reviews. You're getting on a paddleboard in the ocean....OF COURSE YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO SWIM!!! Seriously? If you're a person that lacks common sense, you can't blame the world for not hand-holding you but I digress. They do give you a short questionnaire finding out how knowledgeable you are in paddling and yoga. I did see Sarah working with people who have never been on a paddleboard before. She is a really fun instructor and leads a good class. She switches things up and gives you things to try for all abilities. If you've done yoga before, I don't have to explain the feeling you have after a yoga class. The only difference here is that you feel a little more accomplished and get extra relaxation during your Shavasana when you're floating! Whether you're just in town for a few days or you live local, it's definitely worth doing! I drive from Woodland Hills (there's probably a hundred yoga studios that are closer).

A friend invited me to join the Sat 11am class with Sarah. We reserved our spots online and when we arrived at the parking lot we spotted the Yogaqua truck where we filled out some papers as well as were asked about our abilities for yoga and paddleboarding. The whole class is 90 mins - 30 mins of paddleboarding and then 60 of yoga. You do have to carry your paddleboard which is specially designed for yoga, life jacket and buoy out to the marina at the start and end of each class. I've only gone paddleboarding once and am a beginner yogi but had a blast! The 30 mins of paddleboarding was a leisure go at your own pace where we went out in the marina and then came back in; and the 60 mins of yoga covered basic moves at least for our class. I have no problem going through these moves while on a mat however being on a paddleboard does add another layer to the experience however I've been told it gets easier! Plus we had a beautiful day even in mid January though I did not fall in which would have been a different story (I'm sure in the summer it is nice!). Shavasana was incredibly soothing as the water lapped against the board with the sun shining down on us that morning. Also during the class Yogaqua takes pictures that are posted on their Facebook wall so you can take a look after.

Dr. Billauer and Dr. Reiss believe that there is tremendous value to be gained from combining western and natural medicine in the care of patients. They evaluate each patient to identify their unique challenges to health and wellness and create individualized treatment approaches to optimize their well-being.
Patients facing acute or chronic illness, pain, or other challenging physical or mental health conditions need help to get well. Generally, they have two options: they can choose western medicine, or they can use more natural approaches. Unfortunately, those two approaches rarely intersect.

What make him stand out is his warm and friendly personality, and genuine interest in his students' growth. I became one of his many students who went from not even knowing the basics to being able to participate in performances on stage and even competition.  If your goal is to start learning salsa or bachata, or to take your dancing to the next level, try Javier out.

I saw good their reviews from yelp   , so I decided to give it a try . I took a free ballroom dance lesson from another teacher whose name is Rebecca . After her ballroom class, I felt I had learned a lot and had a great experience . I think she's a excellent teacher! Because of that, I purchased 10 times pass package from this studio; however, after I took Laura's class , I totally regretted because her teaching way is very confused compare with Rebecca's ! I asked her how many more level one class I have to take so that I can move to next level (BC I expected to have another teacher to teach me for next level! )She told me it depends on how I feel !  So after I took her second class which she taught us almost same stuff from the first one, I felt I should move to next level because at least I don't have to take her class anymore , but she didn't allow me to do that,  and she wanted me to stick with her level 1 class in a very rude and disrespectful way. Although the package is not that pricy, I feel it just waste my time to take her class.",HWsomdoAa3EfjaAVOCVGcw,Sunny Y.,90066

You never know what to expect when trying a new dance class for the first time and it can be an unsatisfying experience. It was just as I'd hoped. Professional but not serious.  Broke it down so everyone could understand. Considerate instruction. Teacher made sure everyone got it before moving on to the next thing.  It's easy for a teacher to get bored with beginning instruction but both instructors I had were never bored or irritated.  Gave us tips to make us look good. Good humor.  Nice to see just as many men as women. You play musical partners so you dance with everyone in the room more than once. If you come with your own partner you don't have to switch partners at all if you don't want to. Age range in my classes were early 20's to 60's. They don't mind you just sitting in to watch. You can practice in the studio any time you want if there's no class going on. First class is free and they have a great deal on unlimited classes.

He worked w/ us and made us feel like we could actually dance, as well as curtailed our 1st dance to certain things we saw online that we just loved.

The Vals (waltz) was elegant, the Surprise Dance (a Michael Jackson Mashup) was fun, and all of the kids looked and felt amazing! Michael did a great job of making sure that our Quinceanera princess stayed the center of attention, while also making sure that the rest of the court complimented her and looked good. The teens all loved him, as he has a very young spirit and makes learning fun. We were definitely concerned at first, as it seemed that many of the kids had never danced before, and looked hopeless. The dance is a huge part of a Quinceanera, and we really wanted it to be great. Well it turned out better then great...It was PERFECT! Seriously. I couldn't imagine changing or improving a single thing. Everyone loved it, and we had at least a dozen people asking who our choreographer was!

The space is small, but felt like a perfect fit for someone like me who feels overwhelmed a bit at Exhale or Yogaworks down the street. Also, I showed up once for a midday mid-week class that I didn't realize had been cancelled (I think the monthly schedule had changed) and an instructor felt badly and gave me a private one-on-one session to make sure my trip wasn't for nothing. They could have easily just said sorry & added a class to my Groupon or something, but I LOVE that they went above & beyond!

It's taken years for me to find just the right fit in a yoga studio -- a good balance of hippie dippie, serious workout, and comfortable environment. There's no crazy Vinnie Marino classic rock, no anorexic Montana chicks, just really good solid yoga taught by instructors who are patient, caring, and skilled.

They focus on the physical and mental aspects of wellbeing. All the classes are good, though my favorite is Sculpt, which is a combo of yoga, strength and cardio. You can't go wrong with any of the trainers, but I especially recommend Belden, Victoria, Sophronia and Missy. They follow the typical format but always mix things up to keep it new, interesting and challenging. The studio is well designed, modern and very clean. Parking is convenient in the adjacent lot as well as Trader Joe's across the street. You will definitely need to bring a towel and water as you sweat a lot and the classes are hard (especially the heated ones).

As a college student, it is tough to get into class with such a busy schedule, but the late class allows me to get in and prevents me from making any excuses. I live in Encinitas over the summers and they do not have this late of a class. It makes me miss the Westwood location so much! I love how the classes here are a mix of calming yoga but they also provide a tough workout that leaves me feeling sore.

They allow a week free to new members without even checking their identification. All the person has to do  is sign their name on an IPad and fill in a couple sheets of paper and they are in for the free week. This results in people coming in with false identities and has resulted in multiple robberies.  Last week a couple went into the studio and gave fake names while signing up. Once the classes started the couple went into the mens and womens locker rooms and went through the lockers and stole items including my credit card and money from my wives purse. Had Corepower Yoga had a proper security measure in place we would know who this couple was who signed up and then did not go into the class when it started. The instructor recalls signing in the couple but because they didnt have the real names of this couple, they are long gone and got away with a crime because of negligence at Corepower Yoga. Also while classes are in session there is nobody at the front desk of the studio which doesnt seem to be very safe either. On top of that we reported this issue to the head of human resources at Corepower  Yoga and she was extremely rude and will not even assure us a plan to improve their security. My wife and I are extremely disappointed because we actually liked the classes there. Its too bad it is not a safe place and the rudeness of their management has left a bad taste in our mouth...",RTmC3lI8M79Z-ZSICIbzEw,Lance J.,90024

There were refreshments, hair braided, and instructors as well as managers available to answer your questions. Their first yoga classes were jam packed. After the class, everyone talked about how wonderful the instructors were. The manager is extreme nice! She taught an amazing class! I overheard her team members spoke about how much time she spent on getting ready for the grand opening. I can see it paid off. My son has sport activities at UCLA every weekend.

What was really unhealthy was one of the staff members sprayed Lysol in the room right before we started class. Yikes... it is bad enough that they don't air the rooms out, and then to spray toxic chemicals in the room is wow unbelievable. You would think a yoga studio would be conscious of a healthy environment.

Madison is like my favourite teacher ever for HPF(a mix of hot and power yoga) I walked into studio 1 and it was already at 100(they have non hot classes, but I am old and have creaky joints so I need full heat) Madison led us through a great class  and she made me feel at home(my home CPY is Winchester and Palo Alto) she was just super genuine and sweet and I got there early so we had a little chat at front desk. Now Megan had a big act to follow and she came in with the tunes, it was like Buddha Bar meets a super tranquil Cirque du Soleil. She did not let me down at all, in fact I was impressed. I just loved both of these cool teachers and the vibe was amazing. And shout out to my fellow classmates, I like a CPY where people are encouraging each other and socialising and this one was friendly in that way too!

There are many other gyms out there that will treat you with respect.  Don't let the frills fool you.",bD8YFz0AoSgYroZfA0tbmw,abby w.,90401

For example, the Yoga that they advertise is more like show off gymnastics. This attitude is openly displayed on their blog which honors contortionist poses over all else and even goes as far as discrediting students who assume ""child's pose"" as being of a lesser class.  As far as my club experiences?  Unlike the other reviewer, I have had a terrible experience with Darrin, the manager. When I had a complaint, I was dismissed and patronized. I stick around because I like several of the instructors, and because I know how to make my own adaptations according to my age and body type. I am certain that the classes are downright dangerous for many. Furthermore, it is a shame that sports club was bought out, as they valued the individual and welcomed critics, even those who may have at first seemed unreasonable or difficult.  If Equinox continues to turn its back on the individual, I suggest they sell the clubs at the height of their success. Perhaps that is why they have assumed such a shallow model of business.  They are going to get out  and make money at the height of the empty buzz they have created.

THE BAD: Had several thefts (ipod, aluminum water bottle, locks, headset) Parking is ridiculous and very crowded. No swimming pool. Price just got hiked to $150/mo. In this economy it's shocking to set a price hike. The mens locker room is way too small and poorly laid out, which takes away the main benefit of the gym/spa. Hard to maneuver in there and that's a complaint I hear from many people. A friend of mine just quit the club because of that. Also, mats are always full as is much of the gym for people who use Trainers. Those who use trainers also get better treatment, like they use up gym space that you need to workout.

So then I come out and the guy I'm with is waiting for me. They actually messed up on the treatment time. Like how could you not look at the appointment time? I was frustrated and annoyed. Apparently they have a high turnover and no one is trained properly within the Spa. The employee who helped me at checkout was checking people in and trying to do other things at the same time. He had no help no back up! So it was slightly rude. As you are talking to him he would walk away. But not his fault the management should have help at the counter. THEN he confirmed that in the system they had 80min!!! FOR THE MASSAGE so why on earth was it cut short? UGH! Anyway ruined my surprise and treat for the person I took. I would highly recommend they train people the right way and not let things like this effect other paying customers experience within their Spa. Also there was no changing room or locker and no robes! If you are looking for a spa spa experience. I would recommend going to another place.

How can management be so unaware that another company is basically operating out of the club and that employees are all wearing t-shirts promoting another fitness company.  Equinox corporate should be made aware that another company is branding itself out of one its clubs and using the club itself and the clubs equipment to sell a product for another company. If you value your privacy do not join this club.  Employees are constantly taking photos of themselves (usually shirtless or shoeless, which are both against company policy) and posting them on social media sites.  Unsuspecting members are usually caught in the pictures they are posting and, as a result, are being put up on social media without their consent.  Several employees have posted pictures of celebrities working out in the gym which is a complete invasion of their privacy and against club policies.  These employees should be fired.  The young boy that sells memberships is also very unprofessional.  He sits in his office all day with his feet up on the desk.  When you sit in a glass enclosed walled office where everyone entering the club can see you this should not be tolerated.  This membership advisor works out shirtless and walks around in bare feet and also posts pictures on the internet of himself and his friends all shirtless working out at the gym.   He treats the gym like it is his own personal playground.  The only thing missing at this gym is a swing set.",5pNpwMq9dqids1JaFTdVcA,Troy B.,90401

The upstairs level which is the busiest is so jam packed with people and equipment and in my honest opinion there's not a lot of space. The only good thing going for the gym is the attempted views and partial outside fitness area they offer, but that's it. They also don't have a lot of equipment like the other gyms offer and they can't put more bc they have no room. They lack ab equipment as well as other equipment that most gyms have.

Since then I've had frequent troubles with this location and this gym in general. The razors are not always stocked, the towels are not always clean, it is super busy all the time, and the showers have hair, shaving cream on the walls, they flood and the ceilings leak. Recently this last Friday the whole ceiling in the shower area was leaking. Not just in the enclosed showers individually, but the whole ~500 square foot area. I was concerned and asked the front desk what the leak was and where was it coming from- the old dirty pipes containing dirty shower water or from roof issues. The front desk seemed like I was in the wrong for asking and didn't know anything of it. Finally after asking for someone to get more information she came back and started helping other customers. I had to wait and ask again what she found out and all she told me was ""they are fixing it"". I think for $240 a month more could have been said. They acted as if they didn't know or cared which left me thinking even upper management didn't know. I then asked to cancel my membership and of course they pulled out the contract and said only if I lose my job, move so far away, or have medical reason can I cancel the membership. I then asked for the managers information and a person at the front desk gave me an assistant managers business card to screen my complaints. Very unprofessional and rude. The customer service here, or lack thereof, is appalling.  The staff treats members as if they are second class citizens. This place is disgusting, and when problems arise they are clueless.",ZkVIyhCjkh44YHAyVcHBDw,Zenetra N.,90401

Three years ago my beloved family dog and my amazing Granma passed away within two days of each other. Heartbroken does not begin to describe my grief. A day later, my nephew was born. I was overjoyed and filled with a love I didn't know existed. Experiencing these intense highs and lows was shocking to my nervous system. I was scared and confused--crying all the time--never sure how I felt and always questioning what life meant. I began therapy and was advised to try yoga. Wiping away tears, I googled ""yoga near me"" and I happened upon a Groupon for Laughing Frog Yoga. Nervous and desperate, I attended my first class. The teacher welcomed me, poured into me (noticing my tears) and told me it was going to be okay. I came back the next day. And the next day. And the next day. Three years have gone by and I am proud to say that Laughing Frog Yoga has changed my life. ",-Fm_AumogsWGt0mHKouqwg,Diana M.,90025

However since then, any studio I visited to practice at hasn't felt like a place that I could advance further in what I learned in teacher training, let alone a place I could call ""Home"". Laughing Frog Studio has some of the best teachers I've come across in LA, and if you know LA that's BIG! Especially for me since I'm already a teacher and am always looking for something to challenge me physically and spiritually. Everyone is exceptional and unique in the style they teach, and every teacher focuses on alignment AND the spiritual practices that yoga brings out in all of us. They offer several options in the early morning, afternoon and evenings along with convenient classes on weekends. (Some studios are closed or only offer an 8am class on Sat/Sun which I would never wake up for!)  What I love most is that I've been able to see the growth laughing frog has made as a studio. Just this year it was founded by new ownership and the new studio owner is a sweetheart! He is very active in the studio and is always welcoming. He has fixed up this place so much with new mats, art, candles etc and a beautifully renovated reception/welcoming space. There's FREE parking underneath the studio and some spots available on the street too which is rare because usually you have to pay in Santa Monica.

I have another studio right around the corner and I still drive here(10 minutes away).There is ample parking. The only thing I don't like that has nothing to do with studio is people drive fast in parking lot, someone almost ran me over after class( defeats the purpose of yoga right?) but ALL my teachers have a wonderful vibe. I've taken Jodi's class, Ivories, Jacqlyns, the Sunday morning yoga class when she sings to us and the yin yang by another wonderful instructor.

The goats were very cute, although it would've been nice if they could have roamed freely instead of following the trainer who constantly directed them with treats. What ruined a fairly enjoyable experience (I'm not calling it a ""class"" because of the lack of instruction and direction in yoga positions) was the instructor's haughty attitude when we asked her for help in cleaning our mats after the goats pooped on them. Celia's curt, one-line answer to us when we whispered the question whether we could get wipes to clean off our mats was ""I am the teacher.""  Well, I am a teacher, too, and I don't consider myself above helping all of my students with whatever their needs are.  I certainly don't consider myself above helping them feel comfortable in my classroom.  It would have taken her 10 seconds to simply point to the cleaning supplies in the back of the classroom or ask someone to help us.  Instead, it took us several minutes to figure out on our own who to ask for help and how to get wipes to clean pieces of goat poop off our mats. We definitely won't be back for goat yoga or any other yoga experience at Laughing Frog Yoga.

As an animal lover I truly appreciated their presence. Minus 3 stars for the staff and gimmicky way class is executed. The site clearly says $2 rental for mats but they charged me and my husband TEN each. Major rip off, and dishonest. The yoga instructor was marginal at best. Choppy instruction with poor grammar. The goat trainer was very nice but I did not care for the way she coached the goats on everyone through the entire class. It was not authentic at all. I would have preferred the goats just wander and play at their own will with photo opp at the end. In a class of 30 their were about 6ppl who actually came to practice yoga. The rest were laughing and taking photos the whole time like they were kindergarteners. It was disruptive and annoying.

The massage therapists who work with him are also great and have been with him a long time as well which says something about his character.  In the past I had only gone to him for minor issues, like when I tweaked my neck. But recently I was diagnosed with sciatica due to periformis syndrome.  In bad pain, I went to a nearby orthopedist. He gave me some painkillers which did nothing and set me up with some physical therapy.  The PTs were great, but the doctor had warned me not to get any chiropractic adjustments. But having trusted Dr. Weitz for 15 years, I went to him and told him what had happened. The PT has helped, but I know the massages and adjustments were what sped up my recovery enormously.

Achieving a steady improvement in balance, muscle tone and overall fitness in a very eclectic group of people is something that rates extremely highly in my opinion. We approached Tanner with specific exercise and fitness needs, some of them old injuries, some of them age related and some of them simply desired changes. He willingly took us on and has enabled transformation in a professional and highly competent way. The ability to challenge each person and achieve goals has been understood and very, very appropriately implemented. I could not be more grateful for the incredible holistic approach adopted at this gym. From Tanner's amazing knowledge of diet and food to his extraordinary ability to tailor exercises for your particular pain needs, he is certainly the best trainer I have ever had.

The trainers are motivating, knowledgeable and most importantly focused on proper form and execution. Their goal is to help everyone look and feel their best. Their workouts are designed to build a solid foundation improving strength, mobility and endurance.

We started with one of my current mid-irons. After a few swings, a couple of which were flushed, Jason showed me the stats for that set of swings, deleting the mishits and using the good swings to establish a baseline. We then followed the same process, hitting a few shots with different shafts and heads, comparing the feel and the Trackman data generated from the good swings I made to choose the best shafts and heads for me.

The biggest difference between Hot Stix and Club Champion is CC has all shafts on hand so you get to hit it immediately. (instant feedback) Hot Stix unfortunately did not have any shafts on hand so they make recommendations and you go buy them hoping they work (they did). That was one of the main reasons I chose Club Champion. I wanted real time data. I have been playing with the clubs they recommended for the past 6 years and It was time for an upgrade.

,2929 Santa Monica Blvd,5.0,"Golf Equipment,Golf Lessons",Club Champion,31,5,,7/18/2018,"This is the second time my wife and I have had our clubs custom fit and built by Club Champions in Santa Monica. Our clubs were stolen at North Star golf course in Lake Tahoe during the Fourth of July holiday. It was a little over a year since our original fitting, so we were not sure how many of our clubs were still available. Jerry Azurin (club fitter) was able to obtain the Mizuno club heads and shafts from the original fitting at a discounted price, refit my hybrids an woods with upgraded heads and Padderson shafts (same shafts as the other set). The GBB Epic head was no longer available so we tried the Rogue and the Ping Gmax heads on the Patterson shafts. Definitely hit the Gmax longer and straighter.  Jerry did not charge us for the fitting because the set was very similar to the stolen club spec's. Overall I believe we were able to replace our clubs with a set even better than before and at a price that will help offset some of our insurance deductible       Thanks Jerry and Club Champions",xZFwMXD2Hi-MpBAE-QMdjQ,Steve K.,90404
,2929 Santa Monica Blvd,5.0,"Golf Equipment,Golf Lessons",Club Champion,31,3,,12/3/2017,"I'm giving them 3 stars because Jerry did a great job with the fitting.  My issue is with the concept, itself.  I'm a 16 handicap and I have a feeling that a much better player, like a single digit handicapper, may benefit from Club Champion.  For someone of my ability, though, I would have to say it's a waste of a LOT of money.  I was fitted for a putter and wedges.  The putter is fine, although the advertisement in Golf magazine about making 43% more putts, is the snake oil claim it sounds like.  I'm not making any more putts than I did with my old putter.  The fitting process for the wedges is the same I as received at Golf Smith when I purchased, there.  It's a launch monitor and contact tape.  The difference is at Golf Smith they put the cost of your fitting towards your purchase.....at CC, they do not.  The cost of the new putter and 3 wedges was $1,100.  I've since switched back to my old wedges, as I couldn't hit the new ones nearly as well.   As I said, Jerry did a great job.....he did not give me the hard sell....he simply presented the data from the fitting.  I went in with eyes wide open and I decided to spend the money in the hopes of getting a superior product.  My disappointment is the the product, not the service.",ur8gi-D0h0QPIJ6HGIVRvg,Mason L.,90404

And by that, I mean 10 years overdue. Yup, that's for how long I have been seeing physical therapist extraordinaire, Martina Fogt, at Bebe PT. Unlike many of the women who go to Bebe PT, I have a chronic condition (a myopathy) that requires ongoing physical therapy, so if there's one review you can trust on here, it's mine. When you first walk into Bebe PT, you are greeted by Erika at the front desk. She is warm, welcoming, professional and incredibly efficient and good at what she does. (This includes knowing the insurance plans inside and out.) As you walk into the main area, there is a sense of warmth and calm. (And always really good music in the background.) Women are so well taken care of there- both physically and psychologically-whether it's through massage, exercises on the ball, work on the pilates reformer, or a compassionate ear. All of the physical therapists there have excellent clinical acumen and take your concerns and symptoms seriously. As a physician, I respect and appreciate the thoughtfulness that goes into my treatment plan and also the effort invested in keeping my exercises interesting and fun. If you're pregnant, in the postpartum, having pelvic pain or anything in between, you want to go somewhere you can trust.

I found a groupon for one month unlimited for $79 so decided to check out this place and I really enjoyed my first session. The owner was in the studio and gave me a tour and she was soooo sweet! Gave me a big welcome to LA hug. Such a warm lady. My first class was with Candise who I believe was brand new that day. Her class was great! My second class, on the other hand was with another instructor who I just hated. I have never wanted to walk out of a reformer class in my 5 years of reformer pilates but I wanted to just get off my reformer and walk out. She was rude, condescending, and her music was blaring...at a 7am class nonetheless. I decided I would still go back to at least get my money's worth but just avoid this instructor. I tried Erika Quinn who was absolutely amazing. She is patient, sweet, and her classes are tough but doable. I always leave feeling like I got a great workout. I tried a spin class but was only able to make an early AM Saturday class once or twice. I wish they would offer more morning classes during the week of spin...especially since it is a different room. Anyways, after my month, I decided not to continue and was going to try a new place closer to where I would be moving to but ended up hating that place and am now back at BodyWellness for good! Parking is easy as no one monitors the lot in the early AM (though I heard they validate anyways), they have showers, there is a separate room for privates, reformer pilates, yoga and spin so the schedule is pretty packed with things. The pilates here is definitely top notch and reasonably priced for LA (San Diego was MUCH cheaper) if you buy the unlimited.

I have never tried pilates reformer classes before. Had recently been getting back in shape with boot camps, spinning, and kick boxing, so with the help of groupon I wanted to try another fitness avenue. I first attended the intro workshop which I found helpful in teaching how to set up the machines and how to achieve good form and breathing, but not much else. When I attempted to attend class, I found the exercises too challenging and was not given suggestions on modifications (despite obviously struggling). I wanted to ask the teacher about it after class, but she bolted out the door before I was even done wiping down the machine.  I attended a second class the following week. It was a repeat of week one, complete with the instructor bolting out the door when it was over. Frustrated, I emailed the studio asking about the challenges I was facing and if any helpful suggestions could be made. I received a reply stating I obviously had a back problem and could not return to class without a doctors note. As a result, I was deprived of the 3 remaining classes I purchased for simply asking for help. I'm just glad it wasn't more. The classes on their own are pretty expensive.",-YC7Ag2OvPXzbrFY8EEj4A,Meghan R.,90025

I will not miss a Thursday restorative yoga class because it is just that amazing.

I originally bought a package here because it was reasonably priced for Pilates classes. The problem with the classes is that they aren't really challenging because the instructors aren't correcting your form or pushing you. You're really left on your own to do the exercises. As a result I didn't see any progress over the 10 sessions I took and felt that the classes weren't really effective. I've taken semi privates before in classes of 4 and the instructor was really involved and I saw great results. I'd recommend going to another studio that focuses more on form if you want to get your moneys worth.,jkIxDZhbmL3q2IcCxZjf9Q,Ava R.,90025

Devon is a great instructor and creates a calm and peaceful environment during her classes. She makes sure that each person is comfortable in their poses and I never feel intimated.

They should just offer a first time orientation class where you get the low down on all the different classes so you can actually at least get your money's worth for 30 mins or 45 mins. Also, the app doesn't work well. And you check in online and again in person. and the tea water is not always hot. It's a great startup biz but the prices ought to be much much lower for what it is! And many people just object to having to pay to meditate to begin with since so much of it is based on buddhist dana ""donation"" principals. The teachers are good and it's a great concept and it's fun and but prices seem greedy and the owner needs to rethink the model if she wants to have ongoing loyal customers rather than those who come for a stint and drop out.

And I couldn't have done it without the expert guidance from the wonderful instructors at Unplug. I felt results after only going to meditation classes for 2 weeks! (More on that later if you care to know exactly how it's changed my life and how it could change yours)...  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Unplug!! Suze, the staff and the instructors are all so lovely, warm and friendly- very informative and always willing to chat. The classes are mixed in age and gender- some people have meditated before, but there is always a newbie or few in each class I've taken. At the beginning of class, the instructor begins with either an anecdote that promotes kindness, compassion or relaxation, shares an informative/ scientific fact about how mediation helps you, or simply asks that you set your intention for that day, which you focus on as you practice. Some classes you are guided throughout, with helpful visualization ideas, and some classes are mostly moments of silence, with the instructor speaking every so often to remind you to check in with your breath and relax a little more. You don't have to worry about keeping track of time- you can completely let go and relax, since they will make a sound and start to gently talk again near the end of class. The ambiance in the studio is wonderful and engages all senses- from the soft pink/purple lighting to the lovely scent in the air to the atmospheric sounds and soft voice of the instructor. The décor of the reception area is modern, there's complimentary tea and spa water, interesting articles to read on the wall... and you will totally want to buy all the cute trinkets and books! Unplug is just PERFECT for beginners and for everybody, because- how do I put this... there is no sense of snobbery and you don't have to be a hippy or super religious either... everyone that comes here is just a person like you and me, who wants to find a way to feel better and just chill.

To the point meditation without all the "" follow your bliss"" and ""just choose happiness"" cliches. The teachers/facilitators speak for about 5-10 min before the meditations and I have continually found their words so insightful as it pertains to living and thriving in a big busy city such as this. And the meditation room is so peaceful and lovely, simple and clean as opposed to a bunch of old smelly hippy cushions or uncomfortable chairs. I am so grateful that this place opened.

It's like a yoga studio for your brain. I've taken Mary's class several times and I have to say, she's top notch. Her guided meditations are just as informative as they are relaxing.

Jon Paul Crimi's Breathwork workshop has without a doubt changed my life. It has opened new doors for me emotionally, given me professional visions, and re-emphasized life long dreams of mine.

I specifically want to say that his workshop tonight was absolutely unbelievable. I have never experienced anything like it, the ability to connect with a room of strangers like that, all while working through your own stuff, and better understanding what is happening to you in the process.

I was intrigued by the vibe immediately. The lobby is clean, white, and very soothing, with hushed tones, and the front desk folks are welcoming and friendly. The class was amazing. It was a sound bath meditation which I had never even heard of before and it was absolutely amazing! I felt both calmed and exhilarated and left the class feeling peaceful and wonderful, and excited about attending more classes. I signed up for the 2-week trial and took all the classes I could that fell into my schedule easily so I experienced an assortment of different types of pretty amazing and powerful mediation classes. I liked them so much that I joined unplug as my 2-week trial was ending. After 2 weeks of attending some dozen classes, I feel more calm, more centered, more self-aware, less easily irritated, I sleep much more soundly, and have much less anxiety. I also feel more alert and productive but relaxed; more willing to be in acceptance than to keep feeling upset about things that aren't going my way, more ability to be in the moment and present, than in the past or future.

My fear has kept from even considering it. On a recent trip to Puerto Rico, he encouraged me to go on a Discover Scuba dive. My willingness to give breathing underwater a try was a huge leap of faith. I not only was able to try it, but I was able to relax and I LOVED it.

We waited outside the door of the studio until the young woman made an announcement and let us in. The studio looked exactly like all the photos I had seen, simple, light, relaxing and with a fresh wonderful smell. I had been to other breath-work classes but nothing like this. It was stimulating and incredibly cleansing. I must tell you it is one day later and my entire body is still feeling the effects.

Well then head on down to Bryan Kest's Power Yoga and join the gang! I honestly think that everyone in LA has been to a ""Bryan class"" at one point or another. But with really good reason. First off, the classes are amazing. Whatever your level of yoga-ness, you will walk out of one of these classes feeling like a bad ass yoga mofo. Best of all, you pay for the classes on a ""donation basis."" This, roughly translated, means if you are broke and can't afford to pay 8 million dollars on yoga classes (like the rest of LA seems to be able to do), you can put your dollar bill in the donation box with your head held high. And then, when you finally become a producer or agent, you can pay your 15 bucks like the rest of the LA big shots. The only negative here is that the classes tend to be really crowded, so get there early and claim your spot.",NvAZqXjqOJKcIWFRPiQQbA,Three M.,90401

OK, that may be a little bit dramatized, but when I started going I had a soft body and a perpetual hangover.  After going a couple times a week, I started to feel really healthy.  These classes will make you SWEAT... I don't generally sweat a lot when I work out, and this class has me dripping.  Ditto to what a lot of people said about getting there early to get a spot and prepare to deal with nightmare parking.  And yes, we all love the donation basis.  I've actually never been to one of Bryan's classes, but I've practiced a lot with the other teachers.  Ally is my favorite.  She always brings her iPod and will play music during some of the sequences.  Sometimes it's 80's, sometimes Eminem, but generally not your typical hippie yoga music.  The classes are a serious workout, but also include a lot of really good meditations about life.  I think it's really helped me deal with stress.  I'd say the only downside is that going to a class takes a pretty significant chunk out of your night... The classes are 90 minutes, plus parking time.  But if you're really pressed for time, try the 5:30 am class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Jon the teacher is super nice and always remembers who you are (which I guess is a bad thing if you slack off for a while), and parking issues are nonexistent.",Qapavkdqg7ODkyVsj-1kdg,Mary C.,90401

I'm half Indian, and grew up practicing with my aunt, who is in her late 70s and looks 50, in part due to her practice and clean living. Bryan has created his own brand of yoga with this franchise and it is for sure successful, but it is a departure from even highly active forms of yoga. Those of you who don't want the spiritual stuff - go do another form of exercise...the practice of yoga is for the purpose of moving mediation - meant to connect the body, mind and spirit. This is a very all-about-the-exterior LA experience, so if that's what you want, you'll get it. Not for me.

If you are a first timer you should know that he has two locations within walking distance of each other in Santa Monica. Bryan teaches at the 522 Santa Monica Blvd location. It's a huge open space and people line up down the block to get in.  Although there is room for over 100, people cram in so tightly there is often only about an inch between yoga mats. As the class moves along the room heats up from the warmth of all of the bodies exerting themselves. Bryan calls out poses but never pushes people to go beyond their limits. He compares what he is offering to a buffet and says you don't need to consume it all. He avoids things like chanting in other languages - something I find makes teachers seem aloof since a lot of people don't know what they are saying - and instead offers practical statements designed to help people get their heads on straight. For example, he reminds students that yoga allows them to practice staying calm in difficult situations and that in turn makes it easier for them to stay calm when the real world dishes out troubling situations. His class leaves you physically exhausted and yet completely revitalized. I always left in a state of post-yoga-bliss. The other extraordinary thing about his classes is that they are by donation.

Second, yoga is not supposed to be calisthenics.  If you pause during the class, look around, everyone is doing a different variation of the same poses -- all of the people are unlike the other. Straight backs, arched backs, legs too wide, legs too close.  I've been doing yoga for years and I know how to do the poses and, I guess, the rest of the people in the class think that also.  Try Exhale with Hala where she'll emphasize how to do the poses correctly and leave you in the poses long enough so your muscles not only stretch, but strengthen.",J5WK0k5tiKfs3t8GNdwWrw,S G.,90401

He has a manner of talking to the class so that whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner of yoga you will feel individually challenged yet safe. He wants everyone in his class to respect themselves and he will constantly remind everyone in the room to back off if you feel like you are pushing yourself beyond what is healthy.  He has a manner of being spiritual without sounding like he is full of  yogi B.S. I walk out of there feeling good about my body and soul. He makes you want to go home and hug your mother and he makes you forget about the rat race in just one session. Life feels good after 90 minutes with Bryan. By the way, I have been attending his classes for a year and my body has never looked better. He will help you learn to love yourself.

I felt my body going through various poses which focused on strengthen my body and mainly my core area. We would hold poses longer so that we would push our bodies to work our muscles and challenge them to hold poses a little longer than most. Whenever the pose got to be a little challenging he would instruct us to go to child's pose. He also had a nice sense of humor and flow to his speech which brought light and humor which is something that I like in an instructor because it shows off their personality.

Someone does sweep a large dry mop across the floor between classes, but there isn't any type of Clorox, or febreeze, or anything to help with the smell. It's really musty and uncomfortable when you enter the class. I know it's hot yoga, but I always thought you should work up to a sweaty state, but be hit with it before the class starts.
