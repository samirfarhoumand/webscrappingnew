Decent street parking, friendly and genuine receptionist and instructors (love Alexis and Andrea), hip hop slow jams. At first worried it wasn't going to be much of a workout bc it's stretching and I got my first 2 classes for $20, but it's no joke if you are hoping to push yourself. I think most the classes are a 15 min warm up, then deep long stretches for 40, then a 5 min cool off. That routine wakes up your body like I have never known!",56riXl8s7uGH_i7WXP5yuQ,Sade X.,90211

It's fast, its upbeat, you don't necessarily get a break, and you're constantly switching your gears on whatever workout machine you're on. When I say constantly, I mean almost every 90 seconds. I couldn't catch up, and I still couldn't after my second visit. You either start with the treadmill, or you start with the rowing machine. During your half hour on the first machine, you're told by the trainer to either speed it up, and go back to your regular mode, then back and forth. For the other half of the class (whether it's the first or second), you're working on the weights and springboards.

,6015 Santa Monica Blvd,5.0,Boot Camps,Body Los Angeles,1,5,Hollywood,8/6/2019,"Jenn Glysson's classes are amazing. I've been working out consistently for the past 5+ years and it's not easy to find a class like hers. She runs classes out of a small studio equipped with free weights, TRX, a sled, boxes, and lots of bands. She encourages everyone to roll or stretch before class; then every class begins with a dynamic warmup. She usually does some band work to help warm up/work the lower body stabilizers - this is super key! Then the class is usually a series of different circuits. Sometimes she incorporates speed and agility drills. Since I've started going to her classes regularly, I've become 1. stronger, 2. faster, and 3. less pain! I used to get pain in one of my knees from jump roping and it went away in a matter of weeks. I also noticed that a lot of personal trainers LOVE her classes.

During our one hour sessions, she patiently explained how my muscles were interconnected with my central nervous system and taught me how to reconnect my brain with my ""sleepy"" glute muscles. Her positive and nurturing personality have helped me to develop a better understanding and better relationship with my body.    After the first two months of therapy,  Kristina was able to accomplish what 3 other physical therapists could not do in 6 months - end the burning nerve pain that I had been experiencing.  I have just completed fourth months of therapy with Kristina and went on my first vacation in over a year to Hawaii where I went on a 2 mile hike through the jungle with no pain!   I can't say enough about how wonderful my experience has been with Kristina.  I am looking forward to taking some dance and flexibility classes at Fit and Bendy over the several months.",YNK1Cfv6tj4-6P0p9VY51A,Rosie F.,90065

I like that there are so many class times available, so for those with flexible or inflexible work schedules, you should be able to find a time that works for you. I do wish there was more emphasis on chest exercises (shoulders and legs get the bulk of focus from my experience here), however they allow full time members to have access to the gym (""open gym"" they call it) so if you need to do any kind of supplemental work, that's a big benefit. What I appreciate most here is that the coaches take an active interest in your fitness growth and are big on injury-prevention, so they do care.

Lucky for me he had one opening and it fit my schedule. So I came in for my first session and immediately got intimidated. HE'S HUGE!  But when we finished that session, I was in a pool of sweat and was convinced I made the best decision for my transformation. He pushes when needed while teaching his techniques. From his size you'd think he lifts really heavy, but he doesn't. He trains smart and gets the results. And it's happening for me now. He's also extremely knowledgeable on injuries. I have a bad should and he knows how to adjust my sessions so I still get the maximum benefit without further injuries. Do I hate him at times?  At least once or twice a session. But what a great guy behind that huge facade. I'm under his guidance, I'm changing my body, I'm changing my outlook towards food, while developing a friendship with him that I will cherish and hate for a very long time.

I decided to ask Eric about the possibility of training me. After having a conversation about what my fitness goals were Eric and I started training 3 times a week.  He is the first trainer I have ever trained with that thinks outside the box! He comes up with the most innovative and kick butt workouts that challenge me each and every time.  One of my goals was to do a fitness photo shoot and after training with Eric for a few months he got me photo shoot ready. Eric is the best trainer I have ever trained with to date and I will continue to train with him. You won't be disappointed.  I call it an investment in my health because it's money well spent.

Looked at a few training gyms throughout the westside and was not impressed by the packed shared facilities, setup or pricing. So glad I came across Kekoa Fitness! In the six months I've been going my strength and overall fitness has improved immensely! Rick is truly an expert and knows exactly how to design a workout regiment based on your needs. He's very detail oriented and makes sure you are using the right technique, unlike some other trainers I've had, which has made a huge difference. You can tell Rick, and Gary as well, really enjoy their work, care about their clients, and are truly happy when you make progress in your fitness goals. Rick is always positive and goes the extra mile to make sure you're also eating right and taking the right protein/nutritional supplements. He knows when you come in if haven't been eating correctly/following the nutritional plan haha. I actually look forward to going to workout! 90% of the time it's like having your own personal gym with just you and a trainer, unlike other facilities I've gone to or seen where you're sharing space and equipment with a ton of other people. It's very personalized. Honestly Kekoa Fitness is the best thing I've come across in LA so far. I highly recommend if you're looking to dedicate yourself to train and get in shape. Pricing, particularly if you do a package deal, is very good compared to other trainers' prices in LA as well. Kekoa is a gem and I will definitely be a longterm client!",wCgJK3gg1BRP0noBj9he9Q,Brandon W.,90020

We first met Gary (the owner) for more information about the gym, and from the bat we could tell how much he enjoys and cares about what he does and the people he works with. From there, we've trained with Christian, Bunny, and Gary; all different styles that all get you great results! Right now we're training with Bunny and Gary every week, and their training styles definitely complement one another. We have yet to train with Rick (the manager), but I watch him with his other clients and you can tell he too knows his stuff! I can't recommend this place more; the gains speak for themselves!",DOF8Di0mkGdvEMRJkwr0UA,Gabriella A.,90020
