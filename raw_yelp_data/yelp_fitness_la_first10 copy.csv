Decent street parking, friendly and genuine receptionist and instructors (love Alexis and Andrea), hip hop slow jams. At first worried it wasn't going to be much of a workout bc it's stretching and I got my first 2 classes for $20, but it's no joke if you are hoping to push yourself. I think most the classes are a 15 min warm up, then deep long stretches for 40, then a 5 min cool off. That routine wakes up your body like I have never known!",56riXl8s7uGH_i7WXP5yuQ,Sade X.,90211

I couldn't catch up, and I still couldn't after my second visit. You either start with the treadmill, or you start with the rowing machine. During your half hour on the first machine, you're told by the trainer to either speed it up, and go back to your regular mode, then back and forth. For the other half of the class (whether it's the first or second), you're working on the weights and springboards.

,6015 Santa Monica Blvd,5.0,Boot Camps,Body Los Angeles,1,5,Hollywood,8/6/2019,"Jenn Glysson's classes are amazing. I've been working out consistently for the past 5+ years and it's not easy to find a class like hers. She runs classes out of a small studio equipped with free weights, TRX, a sled, boxes, and lots of bands. She encourages everyone to roll or stretch before class; then every class begins with a dynamic warmup. She usually does some band work to help warm up/work the lower body stabilizers - this is super key! Then the class is usually a series of different circuits. Sometimes she incorporates speed and agility drills. Since I've started going to her classes regularly, I've become 1. stronger, 2. faster, and 3. less pain! I used to get pain in one of my knees from jump roping and it went away in a matter of weeks. I also noticed that a lot of personal trainers LOVE her classes.

Â I had been to several doctors, chiropractors, acupuncturists, and physical therapists and none were able to figure out how best to treat my injury which produced excruciating nerve pain down the front and back of my right leg. Â It turns out that my glute muscles on the right side had atrophied as a result of my injury and Kristina helped me to re-engage those muscles with a combination of muscle activation exercises and stretches. Â Her knowledge of the muscles in the human body is extensive! During our one hour sessions, she patiently explained how my muscles were interconnected with my central nervous system and taught me how to reconnect my brain with my ""sleepy"" glute muscles. Her positive and nurturing personality have helped me to develop a better understanding and better relationship with my body. Â  Â After the first two months of therapy, Â Kristina was able to accomplish what 3 other physical therapists could not do in 6 months - end the burning nerve pain that I had been experiencing. Â I have just completed fourth months of therapy with Kristina and went on my first vacation in over a year to Hawaii where I went on a 2 mile hike through the jungle with no pain!

As a Gay man, how could I not? Â HE'S GORGEOUS! Â But as time past, I realized his knowledge and skills from his incredible physique. So I bit the bullet and reached out to him. Lucky for me he had one opening and it fit my schedule. So I came in for my first session and immediately got intimidated. HE'S HUGE! Â But when we finished that session, I was in a pool of sweat and was convinced I made the best decision for my transformation. He pushes when needed while teaching his techniques. From his size you'd think he lifts really heavy, but he doesn't. He trains smart and gets the results. And it's happening for me now. He's also extremely knowledgeable on injuries. I have a bad should and he knows how to adjust my sessions so I still get the maximum benefit without further injuries. Do I hate him at times? Â At least once or twice a session. But what a great guy behind that huge facade. I'm under his guidance, I'm changing my body, I'm changing my outlook towards food, while developing a friendship with him that I will cherish and hate for a very long time.

He is so caring and supportive with his clients! He really pushes me to do my best in a positive and upbeat way. He's not negative or like a drill sergeant, but he gets the job done!! I am training for my first NPC Bikini Competition and he is coaching me for it! I have never done anything like this before and he knows all the ins and outs and is walking me thru the process. I've had lots of Personal Trainers, but never one like him! He's one of a kind! The gym is really clean and well put together. They have equipment I've never seen before and fun things like battle ropes and tires. I would definitely recommend Rick and his personal training!!!",XQZD56rxNU5QVrDXPzq1JA,Josephine G.,90020

Looked at a few training gyms throughout the westside and was not impressed by the packed shared facilities, setup or pricing. So glad I came across Kekoa Fitness! In the six months I've been going my strength and overall fitness has improved immensely! Rick is truly an expert and knows exactly how to design a workout regiment based on your needs. He's very detail oriented and makes sure you are using the right technique, unlike some other trainers I've had, which has made a huge difference. You can tell Rick, and Gary as well, really enjoy their work, care about their clients, and are truly happy when you make progress in your fitness goals. Rick is always positive and goes the extra mile to make sure you're also eating right and taking the right protein/nutritional supplements. He knows when you come in if haven't been eating correctly/following the nutritional plan haha. I actually look forward to going to workout! 90% of the time it's like having your own personal gym with just you and a trainer, unlike other facilities I've gone to or seen where you're sharing space and equipment with a ton of other people. It's very personalized. Honestly Kekoa Fitness is the best thing I've come across in LA so far. I highly recommend if you're looking to dedicate yourself to train and get in shape. Pricing, particularly if you do a package deal, is very good compared to other trainers' prices in LA as well. Kekoa is a gem and I will definitely be a longterm client!",wCgJK3gg1BRP0noBj9he9Q,Brandon W.,90020

We first met Gary (the owner) for more information about the gym, and from the bat we could tell how much he enjoys and cares about what he does and the people he works with. From there, we've trained with Christian, Bunny, and Gary; all different styles that all get you great results! Right now we're training with Bunny and Gary every week, and their training styles definitely complement one another. We have yet to train with Rick (the manager), but I watch him with his other clients and you can tell he too knows his stuff!
