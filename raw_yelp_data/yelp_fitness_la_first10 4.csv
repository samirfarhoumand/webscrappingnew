No prorated credit back. BUT THEN, WHILE they were closed, they charged all the members AGAIN on APRIL 16. Right afterwards, they had the audacity to send us messages saying they have stopped charging our cards as of April 17 and will extend our memberships, AFTER WE WANT TO CANCEL, for the time they charged and the gym was closed for quarantine. Then an article comes out today about mentions of 24 hour fitness going bankrupt and the CEO commenting about it. How dare you!! We are all in quarantine, none of us are making money, just because you need more money doesn't mean you should steal from the people that automatically have been paying you every months for years.

I only did cardio, utilizing the treadmill, free-stride elliptical, and reclined bike, but all of the equipment I used worked fine and was very clean.

If you're looking to get the best workout (I've never done the same workout here twice) with incredible instructors, I strongly recommend coming out and moving to the beat with us. It's electric here and you will feel the energy the second class starts - or right when you walk in the door. I feel cared about, seen, and loved. I feel physcially and mentally stronger, mentally clearer, and wake up knowing I have a place to go to not only meet and breakthrough my fitness goals, but also have a supportive family/community connection as well. This place is magical and you can't help but feel the contagious positive energy.

The staff is always friendly and makes you feel welcome. I did a 6 month membership here. Towels, lockers, shoes are provided with the membership. Membership also includes access to an In-Body scale which breaks down your weight into muscle and fat percentages so you can see your progress in more detail.

Welcome to Planet Fitness. The Judgement Free Zone®",4645 Venice Blvd,2.5,Gyms,Planet Fitness,262,2,Mid-City,2/29/2020,"I've been a member with planet fitness for about five years now. You can't expect too much cause you get what you pay for. For me, it gets the job done. There are tons of treadmills to get your cardio in. One drawback is that there isn't much to do with weights because the stations are always packed. Nonetheless, it can be done. However, the reason for my two stars is mainly due to the staff members. There were two men (one in a yellow shirt with braids and the other with a black hoodie and glasses) on 02/25/2020 that were making homophobic comments amongst themselves. They were doing this ALL the while the hoodie guy was helping me. I was baffled at the type of conversations they were having-- IN FRONT OF A CUSTOMER. The management really need to retrain these people in what type of conversations they should/should not be having in front of their members. Disgusting.",JheGr-uXeTpGTdyj9XwKWg,Mohammad R.,90019

Usually I bring my charging devices with me but today i forgot a piece of my charGer today. I came to this location because it's near my home. so my phone is about to die and I asked an employee to charge my phone for me. I've done it at plenty of  other planet fitnesses before I come to this particular location and the employee Rob was useless and very unhelpful. IDK if he's under a lot of stress or what. But his customer service sucks and he seems like he  obviously  doesn't want to be here. If he can't assist with  something that small and gets smart with me and says if we charge your phone every one would be doing it for everyone Maybe he should try another line of work.

I appreciate the recent remodel since I feel like things were sort of disorganized and outdated prior to the new signs and rearrangement of equipment. Like other reviews mentioned, this place is pretty much always crowded, especially in the weight area. It's quite offputting to have to wait that long to do your exercises to the point where I've just up and left. My favorite time of the day to go is at night but even then there's tons of people on the mats in the stretching area and it can be hard to find some personal space to do your stretching, warm-ups, and floor exercises. The facility is kept mostly clean in my experience. I've never showered there so I can't really speak to locker room cleanliness. The parking lot is huge but always packed. I hardly go anymore simply because of the crowds. Will likely be canceling my membership in the near future (which you have to do in person, great.)",UHBs95qNK0V-zqmzyK0eHg,Taryn F.,90019

Welcome to Planet Fitness.

I love going to the Burbank and Foothill locations, so I love their gym, but this particular location is the worst. Unfortunately, I go to this one often because it's closer to my work and I rather work out to kill time as traffic dies down. The parking space is small and believe me, this place wreaks! Of course the gym isn't supposed to smell lovely because of all the sweat and body heat, but the other locations have a way of reducing or eliminating that odor. Just recently on Monday (11/4/2019), they brought pizza to the gym. I understand that their intentions were pure and the team simply wanted to treat their guest to some food. However, the placed smelled of body odor and pizza, not a good combo. I'm normally not the type to write a bad review, but I was compelled to do so because this day completely disgusted me. When everyone finished all the pizza, all the boxes were left on the floor/tables and some of the employees just stood there gossiping. Also, the girl's restroom is never clean. I'd always see used/unused toilet paper on the floor, the trash would be piled high, and the soap would sometimes run out. I started to bring my own wipes because I felt grossed how dirty the surrounding be. ",mlxN5HcDxHh-NNRjGbmE1A,Nikole G.,90019

Fitness member for a little less than a year and chose this gym because there is available low cost parking, the sauna, and I really like how big this gym is. Although I love going to the gym and the resources available at this particular location, i.e. gym size, indoor track this gym, sauna, this one particularly has a really bad smell associated to it. Last night, when I went in it almost hit me. It's not the first time but it was pretty bad. The major problem I have other ththan the smell, dirty sauna, is the lack of weights for women.",LhWLaJPycfQ5csO9u8TuHw,Cyrena S.,90028

I simply wanted to know why they don't send a bill before charging their yearly dues and why they don't send receipts. When I question the legality of this Mayra was quick to reply and attach my contract with a scripted passive aggressive email basically telling me tuff shit this is how we do it. Even though it doesn't matter if you signed a contract if it breaks the law it's not legit. So showing me a contract I signed doesn't actually prove that it's legal that they charge me without notifying. It could be legal but the contract does not prove it. Fine whatever moving on I ask her how do I start getting a bill and a receipt every month and suddenly she doesn't know how to answer her emails. ,Y36knTjZzqhW-grfGeyukA,Coco H.,90046
