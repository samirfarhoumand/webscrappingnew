The parking is phenomenal (especially given the location), the staff is super friendly, and it's never too crowded. I'm incredibly picky about gym atmospheres- I don't like to feel like I'm suffocating around too many other people, I need fresh air, I need somewhere reasonable to park (for free), I don't like to wait for equipment, etc. Easton accomplishes all this and more.

They only have 7, maybe 8 treadmills in the back - and up to 3 of them have been out of service lately. I figured they'd fix it asap but weeks have gone by and nothing. As a runner I went to Easton multiple times with the intent to run a few miles but I ended up leaving frustrated after lifting weights for a bit and trying to fight for the next available treadmill. Bummer, as the front staff is always nice and the people there are focused on working out - which is a nice relief from LA.

The machines are older than I am. They need a massive overhaul of equipment. The cafe downstairs is closed which is a bummer and good luck trying to find the class schedule on line as it's rarely updated or the link is dead. I love the exposed brick and am fine with the lack of A/C, but the bathrooms and equipment are ancient pretty gross. Not to mention I've never once seen a cleaning person clean the equipment. And unfortunately I don't see a lot of people clean up after themselves. I once slipped in a pool of sweat from an old guy that was at least two full cups.

Dirk and Chenell are excellent. I'll start with that. They pay incredible attention to your goals, your pre-existing injuries and constantly checking to ensure you're following a suitable routine with both of those things in mind. Despite it technically being four people between two trainers, it always feels like a one-on-one training session. Workouts are curated specifically for your needs and tracked, so you know how many circuits you've done and how you're developing. I'd add that, as a runner of about 10 years, I had been avoiding weights and HIIT simply due to my lack of comfort in that area. This is the perfect environment to learn.

Chenell and Dirk are the trainers and they are phenomenal to say the least. They only do up to 5 people at a time and everyone does a circuit that is completely geered towards them. As a woman, I found that weight training with these guys was all I needed to jump start my metabolism. I've lost over 20 pounds and gained beautiful muscle in all the right places.

I had been taking a Zumba Toning class for two years when my instructor decided to quit teaching dance to sell T-Mobile phones out of a van (sore subject, still upset). ANYWAYYYY, on my first visit to LIFT, I was hoping to find a new fitness routine that I loved - and I wasn't disappointed. I trained with Dirk my first session. I had never devoted any time or money to actual weight training, aside from a bundle of Gold's Gym training sessions I was pressured into purchasing when I first moved to LA. I think I bough five sessions and only redeemed two. It just wasn't my thing. Gyms are such a scene and I prefer to work really hard and get the hell out of there. Basically, I was on the ""do cardio, stay as thin as possible"" former chubby girl cycle of fitness. When I filled out my new LIFT member questionnaire, I wrote ""I would love to come here twice a week, but not sure I can make the financial commitment right now."" It's been five weeks and I have been faithfully attending twice a week. When it's this good, you just find the money. So I don't order postmates as much, who cares?? Chenelle and Dirk run this gym in such a way that working out becomes more than a physical obligation. It's fun. It's something I look forward to. Also, I just like them! I look forward to seeing them and working with them to become a stronger version of myself. Everyone is there to kick their own ass fr 30 minutes. There's no ""LA gym"" pretentiousness"" with LIFT.

This gym is great- UNTIL you try to cancel your membership, or in my case, put it on hold for medical reasons.  Called in Oct. 2018 to put my account on hold for two months because of my high risk pregnancy. I was told it was fine and to call back when I wanted to reinstate it. I then start getting letters from collection agencies because I ""didn't pay"" my fees.  I called them, spoke to Dee, only to find out there were no ""notes"" of my call in Oct placing my account on hold. She said she was going to speak to the owner and call me back. A month goes by- no phone call from Sam or Dee. I called again to follow up and spoke to Joanna and let her know my situation. She takes down my info and calls me back (thank you Joanna!) with info saying she spoke to Sam and waived the two months the collection agency is billing me and was going to call the credit bureau to retract the negative mark on my credit score, BUT I was still on the hook for the two months my account was on hold because it ""extended my contract."" So if it extended my contract two months from October, it should have been up in Dec/January. I said, no problem! I'll pay an extra two months. It is now April and I got charged again and my credit report is still showing the negative mark. Called today and spoke to Valeria who said there were no notes about any of the above info :(  and my contract was now up in June because I started a new contract in October!

He said you're an idiot that's not how it works (we're not together anymore) He was right I was toned as hell the best body I ever had and weighed more than I ever had. So confusing right?

As a person who normally jumps into everything headfirst, without dipping my toes in the water, I can say with complete honesty I was incredibly nervous about coming into this gym. I've been wanting to study Muay Thai for several years now and always put it off, maybe I wasn't ready for the discipline but part of me knows that a great deal of it was because I was nervous about starting something new. After doing some research on gyms online and through yelp, F5 stood out. It is owned and operated by Roxy Vivien, a professional fighter for over ten years, alongside her tight-knit staff. Everyone is welcoming and couraging to newcomers (quick to remind me that everyone starts from the beginning). I also really applaud the fact that they have you take a one-on-one introductory before you start any of your classes. I put down that my focus was going to be on Muay Thai and strength. For my Muay Thai introduction, I was guided by Anthony who gave a great briefing and tutorial. His analogies truly helped with comprehension of theory so I could put it into practice--as a victim of overthinking, this really helped me break things down in my head (THANK YOU ANTHONY). For my strength introduction, Alex coached me through kettle-bell lifting technique. Despite my not having a natural flair and being completely out of my element, Alex's patience and skill helped me through an incredible work out focusing on proper form on the basics.

Located in the iconic Sunset Tower Hotel, Mansion Fitness has created a space that surrounds you with luxury.",8358 Sunset Blvd,4.5,"Gyms,Trainers",Mansion Fitness,40,5,,12/2/2016,"I've been coming to Mansion Fitness three days a week for a couple months since my personal trainer Rodiney Santiago suggested I come to Los Angeles to work with him one on one. I literally moved from Las Vegas to train with him at Mansion Fitness. No regrets! In my youth I was an athlete, so I expected Mansion Fitness to be like every other gym to which I have belonged. However, when I walked into Mansion Fitness my first thought was, ""Holy Smokes!"" The equipment is top notch, the wallpaper is the Haunted Mansion level of cool, and you can't beat the chandeliers. The seating area has super comfy wingback chairs in which I quite enjoy sitting before my sessions with Rodiney. During my sessions, I must say that the music selection is upbeat and fun. Many times while resting between weight circuits, Rodiney and I have danced around like a couple of chipmunks. The environment is conducive to such frivolity. Since clients here work with personal trainers it's not crowded or distracting and even when we need to wait for a machine because it's popular that day, there are plenty of more types to choose from which satisfy another part of my training. The machines are well-maintained and clean. The shower room is well-stocked and clean as are the bathrooms. The lockers are convenient and are located on both the top and bottom floors. The fact is, I come 3 hours one way on a bus and train to get to Mansion Fitness and so I bring a stuffed backpack of necessities; it easily fits in the lockers so that is a huge plus! Lastly, I have to say I walked in thinking that such a classy establishment would harbor elitist staff. I found this to not be the case. The front desk staff are quite friendly and cheery and I've chatted with a few in house trainers while waiting for Rodiney to finish with an early client and have found them to be equally friendly and easygoing. Overall my experience at Mansion Fitness has been very positive and I recommend them to anyone who wants to enjoy their time at the gym as I have thus far.",xussYYBykfHhpIdSBsGI_Q,Maureen J.,90069

A lot of the teachers spend the class time venting about their personal shit while you're standing waiting for the next instruction. Like at least give me something to do while you rant. The worst thinnest toilet paper ever. Trainers who just walk around back-and-forth doing nothing and then stand at the cycle room like it's a podium for them to stare at people while they work out.

I also love how this place is family owned. I just really really really wished that it was a little bit more affordable for specified classes, especially for the are area that is still upcoming and going. For example, it would be a great idea to have class memberships for just spin, or just yoga, etc. But you do get what you pay for and its great here. I had the opportunity to have Arthur as my cycling instructor and he was friendly, motivating and took the time to greet me. I go to sweat cycle in dtla and sometimes you run into those instructors who think they're too important to know they're students (but it is also a facility there). Take this spin class if you're looking to get a good sweat on. Oh, btw, the idea of wearing headsets while spinning threw me off at first, but I then fell in love how intune you get with the instructor and music; rather than the instructor yelling.",uv7m8qV7wHB4EW2inyULfw,Valerie G.,90026

I couldn't catch up, and I still couldn't after my second visit. You either start with the treadmill, or you start with the rowing machine. During your half hour on the first machine, you're told by the trainer to either speed it up, and go back to your regular mode, then back and forth. For the other half of the class (whether it's the first or second), you're working on the weights and springboards.

I tried to book a class but it said I was out of classes so I call the studio and they tell me the classes I canceled I got charged because I canceled after the 8 hour time limit. I was never informed there was a 8 hour cancellation time limit so that sucks for me. ",Wo_nRt78UNTnL7DJ1ujN6A,Nicole U.,90071

The class was semi challenging and worked up an ok sweat however if you're skipping the treadmill you lose a lot of the Barry's experience. I have terrible knees and was limping for a week after running in a previous class. If you're only doing the floor portion then your better off going to a HIIT class which will be significantly cheaper and an less repetitive than doing double floor at Barry's. ,iSTAoK1ZzHwvbHkL3uuOIQ,Hannah N.,90028

It started with me running late to my 6:30pm class at which time I called the front desk to see if I could change to the 7:30pm class. The guy I spoke with was really nice and helpful. Unfortunately, after learning that I was taking the class with ClassPass, he said that he couldn't switch the time because it's booked through a third party. I then asked if I could just arrive a few minutes late since I was right outside the parking garage, to which he emphatically replied, ""yes, you absolutely can!"" Such a simple gesture of making an exception to slight tardiness is so rare at most LA fitness studios that I've been to. Not only did I get to take the class I was so looking forward to (I only missed the warmup) and drove in terrible traffic from downtown to take, but he also spared me that $20+ late fee that ClassPass undoubtedly would have charged me. The rest of my experience with the front desk (e.g checking in, parking validation) was also nothing but warm and friendly. ",ITLAVqZBpI--UVtOHfVS8Q,Rachel S.,90028

FitProsLA has been a life changing experience for me and I am overly grateful that I found this place. All my life I have struggled with weight issues and never had the courage and motivation to get up and go to the gym. I stumbled across this page on Yelp and decided it was time for a change. After meeting with Lara, the owner, I began my training sessions. Before our training began, I sat down with Lara and told her the goals I wanted to achieve. Now, a few months down the line, my body has never felt better. Not only am I seeing constant progress on my weight loss journey but I am now motivated to get up and go to the gym thanks to Lara. I truly cannot thank her enough for all that she has done for me. Without her encouragement and motivation, I would have never made such progress. As for the gym itself, it is centrally located in Downtown LA. I have never had an issue with parking but FitProsLA validates if need be. The gym is extremely clean, well organized and a perfect size. There are healthy snacks, water, small towels, and on-the-go items provided which makes this place a whole lot better.

The music is hype and motivating as well as the instructors.  The only thing is that they do not have showers in case you want to do a class before work.  Overall, I still give it a 5 star for its cleanliness, motivating instructors, effectiveness in shorter duration, friendliness of staff and being located in the heart of West Hollywood!  This place makes me look forward to working out.

I don't know what her preworkout ritual/drink is like, but that woman has hella energy at 6:45am. She has a huge selection of throwback hip-hop mixed with a little sprinkle of EDM for those high intensity high-speed segments. I can barely breathe during class, yet still find myself ""shower singing"" along to her entire track list. She's a FAV!! Rise nation is a Bombdotcom new fitness style.

I called and spoke with a lady that did not give me her name and did not want to give me any information, I requested a refund and she said ok I'll take care of that right now.. I requested a confirmation number she said that there was not one; which was a red flag and I told her that did not sound promising and that I would check to see if I received a refund it's a week later I emailed the company twice and they are giving me the runaround this is horrible customer service.

I never thought that would be possible and I can honestly say i wouldn't have been able to achieve that goal on my own. Shiavash gives you a diet plant to follow and also tells you how much cardio you should be doing every day. If you follow his formula i can promise you you will see results. No fat shaming here! were all here to support each other! If you are looking for a gym in the area please don't hesitate to come to Six Pax Gym.

But then I realized that I hardly even go to the gym due to lack of motivation. I also have a ruptured disc problem causing sciatica and I knew the main method to aid it was through exercise. Because I lacked motivation and knowledge of doing so with the gym membership I had, I decided to give StrengthRx a try since they have classes that you take and teach you all kinds of HIIT and lifting workouts, along with keeping a great diet to reach your most desired goal. It's been 1.5 months now, and I lost about 6% body fat. Not only that, I feel much leaner and lighter whereas the problem on my lower back feels much more relieved and treated properly.

Strength Rx helped kicked my body into high gear! As an older women who is a former athlete of well over 2 decades ago, I felt it was nearly impossible to get my body and health back. I was wrong- the coaches at Strength RX, kicked my butt and literally in 8 weeks, this happened! I started on a "" Free Trial"" but that came with a fee- you don't meet body fat- you loose money but it went towards membership...I felt this was worth it. You get comprehensive meal plans and if you are new to fitness, I strongly encourage following them. ( you can use so many spices, peppers etc to flare up your meals) This gym is a 40 min commute for me- I still try to make it work, because it is that good! The coaches are great, you eventually get to know each one and what their stye of teaching is. I stopped going for 5 months because of 1 month of travel and work issues but just got back on. Let me tell you, no matter your fitness level- YOU CAN DO THIS! There is every body shape and size, don't worry! You start with ""Burn Classes"" everyone in this class is beginners with little to no knowledge or someone that has been doing it and can high five you to get you pumped- So do not be intimated! If you can't do a particular exercise, speak up! Coaches are more than happy to help modify for you or, if are like me and have old sports injuries- IT IS OK! They are not going to make you max out and make you feel bad. This becomes a community, we all help each-other.I just came back after 5 months on a truly free trial to give feedback and I will keep you posted! They genuinely seemed to care what members feel.

Not only did he kick my butt (I was crazy winded after only a few body-weight exercises lol), he took the time to get to know me and my goals and saw potential in me that I didn't even see in myself. When he suggested I try his 12-week PLYO challenge, I was scared I would be totally out of my element and fail.  Fast forward 12 weeks later and I'm now 15 pounds lighter, knocking out 50 burpees at a time like it ain't no thang, and way more energized, fit, & confident overall. It's all about consistency and these trainers and this gym make PLYO the highlight of my day.",RGwsCo0PWtjz2N1qaDRKbQ,Kim S.,90038

It's a little over 1k worth of sessions remaining & I would happily stay at this gym & use the remaining sessions with a different trainer but the woman who was training me insist that's not possible & I that I can not get my money back nor be trained by someone else.

The work outs are always fun, intense and challenging. The instructors are all warm, full of energy and highly skilled and knowledgeable. They will modify any exercise so it can work for you. The community of people who come are also kind. It's a very welcoming vibe, and I find that to be rare in LA. Each class starts with a warm up, and then they break up the class into three groups. You learn three sets of exercises per group, and then you do them for one minute each. Once you are done with the first round, you move on to three new exercises in a different section of the gym. Again, you do each exercise for one minute each, three times through, and then you move on to the third round. Then class ends with everyone doing some ab work together on mats.

We want you safe and working efficiently! So, first round of the circuit is all about getting the form down, second is about about getting stronger and the third time through is about crushing the exercises.
The workouts are presented in two flavors:

BUILD: 

Whether your goal is hypertrophy (gaining muscle mass) or long and lean muscles, this is the class for you!  You will be put through 3 circuits of 3 exercises 3 times!
This means you get 3 touches on each exercise to truly master the lift  and exhaust the muscle group.  This translates to big gains!

SHRED: 

The name says it all.  This total body class is High-intensity interval training (HIIT) at it's best!  You will be put through intervals of high-intensity exercise followed by low intensity exercises.
These workout are designed to burn the fat away!  Come get shredded!

Each class ends with abs and stretching

I know, I know! In a world of 35 minute workouts, why is our workout sooooo long?  I'm glad you asked!  We include a warm-up, HIIT workout, abs, annnnnnd stretching.",423 S Fairfax Ave,5.0,"Circuit Training,Gyms,Interval Training,Gyms",HIIT House LA,60,5,Beverly Grove,9/12/2019,This place is great!!!!

They are huge about cleanliness, so they have disinfecting wipes in a few areas to wipe down before and after use of any of the equipment. They have private two showers, which sold me right away! On top of that! The showers and bathrooms are probably the cleanest ones I've even used! They even have a reasonable shower time limit so that everyone can use it. Tell me why this is the ONLY gym I've gone to where they dont have people staring at you? It's because EVERYONE I have crossed paths with there know we all start our weight loss/muscle gain journeys differently. Plus!! The have AMAZING security protocols, they have plenty of cameras around the building and inside, and the entrance has a sensor that alerts the staff if more then one person enters the gym at the same time.

Everyone who goes there knows ""one person scans their key fob, unlocks they door, walks in, and the next person waits for the door to shut and follow the same steps.... if that isnt safety I don't know what is!

This is definitely the spot to hit up for a great lifting session.

What I love most about this gym is that it's a power lifting type gym that plays very loud awesome music that gets you pumped up for your next set. Has a lot of places where you can squat and bench at and 4 deadlift platforms. Also the employees and people that lifts there cheer and pump each other up to help reach their fitness goals.

I live in the central valley, so it was definitely worth the 3 hour drive. As soon as I walked in, Fabian who was working in the front checked us in and gave us a tour of the place and informed us of the rules. He was helpful and friendly & we shared a conversation and laughs. The vibes were humble and not in your face. Everyone was simply dominating humbly. Bathrooms are extremely clean and were always open when I needed to use it. People working out in the gym were friendly. When I needed to use the dumbbells that another person was using, he was more than happy to share the dumbbells. I wish this gym was closer to where I live. I will definitely be coming back to Barbell Brigade when I'm in LA. Thanks for the awesome pump Barbell!

Bottom floor has the racks (3), dumbbells , stair masters, and most lifting equipment. Top food consists of mostly cardio based machines and some more weighted machines. My favorite aspect of this gym is how clean and well kept it is. Tbh tho it doesn't have as much variety of machines as a franchise gym would, but that is somewhat expected.

Hours can vary based on club special events or non official holidays and they will close the gym without proper notice.

Welcome to Planet Fitness. The Judgement Free Zone®",4645 Venice Blvd,2.5,Gyms,Planet Fitness,262,3,Mid-City,12/31/2019,"I've been a member of this PF club for almost 3 years now and it's a decent location. I appreciate the recent remodel since I feel like things were sort of disorganized and outdated prior to the new signs and rearrangement of equipment. Like other reviews mentioned, this place is pretty much always crowded, especially in the weight area. It's quite offputting to have to wait that long to do your exercises to the point where I've just up and left. My favorite time of the day to go is at night but even then there's tons of people on the mats in the stretching area and it can be hard to find some personal space to do your stretching, warm-ups, and floor exercises. The facility is kept mostly clean in my experience. I've never showered there so I can't really speak to locker room cleanliness. The parking lot is huge but always packed. I hardly go anymore simply because of the crowds. Will likely be canceling my membership in the near future (which you have to do in person, great.)",UHBs95qNK0V-zqmzyK0eHg,Taryn F.,90019

Welcome to Planet Fitness. The Judgement Free Zone®",4645 Venice Blvd,2.5,Gyms,Planet Fitness,262,1,Mid-City,11/6/2019,"I'm a member of planet fitness but thank god I got the black card plan because it allows you to go to any PF location. I love going to the Burbank and Foothill locations, so I love their gym, but this particular location is the worst. Unfortunately, I go to this one often because it's closer to my work and I rather work out to kill time as traffic dies down. The parking space is small and believe me, this place wreaks! Of course the gym isn't supposed to smell lovely because of all the sweat and body heat, but the other locations have a way of reducing or eliminating that odor. Just recently on Monday (11/4/2019), they brought pizza to the gym. I understand that their intentions were pure and the team simply wanted to treat their guest to some food. However, the placed smelled of body odor and pizza, not a good combo. I'm normally not the type to write a bad review, but I was compelled to do so because this day completely disgusted me. When everyone finished all the pizza, all the boxes were left on the floor/tables and some of the employees just stood there gossiping. Also, the girl's restroom is never clean. I'd always see used/unused toilet paper on the floor, the trash would be piled high, and the soap would sometimes run out. I started to bring my own wipes because I felt grossed how dirty the surrounding be. ",mlxN5HcDxHh-NNRjGbmE1A,Nikole G.,90019

Me starting here was a sign from the heavens that it was time to get my fat self up and start moving my body again. I was going to sign up for this gym at one point and put it on the back burner but they texted me for the 6-week challenge on a Thursday saying a challenge was starting on that Monday, well that Monday was my birthday. So if that wasn't a sign I don't know what was.  This may be one of the realist reviews you'll ever read. Before walking into this place I was HUGE, and yes I was the biggest one in the room (still am, but smaller now.) because of my weight. Everyone around me seemed to be athletes all of their lives and I thought they'd be all pretentious and scowling at my fatness, you know the things you think when you're the big person in the room, and you swear you can read the thoughts of everyone around you. Well, what I found was a great team of supportive coaches and motivating classmates who actually care about your well being.  They are all kind, gracious people all with our own separate goals and nobody makes you feel bad about where your starting point is. Mine was in the toilet, lol, I pushed myself a little too hard at first wanting to keep up because I was super hyped by all these Hollywood Bodied People, and in the process, I injured my right knee jumping rope and running. I blame that on my ego of wanting to go so hard when I wasn't prepped for it. Jumping rope was something I'd not done since I was in the 5th grade. When I brought it to my instructor's attention he immediately was on top of it and modified the workouts for me so I could do them without injury, and in that, I have not skipped a beat in my weight loss journey. If you need help ask for it. If you need a better understanding, ask for it. If you aren't sure about something, ask for it, these folks are here to help you, and I can honestly say they've helped me. Again I've been here just a little over 3 months now and from where I started and where I'm heading are night and day. So I highly recommend this gym for those of us who are afraid to get started on changing your weight loss lives and don't know the approaches to getting started. Classes are different every day you never do the same thing twice, and because of that the pounds just peel away with muscle confusion. To date, I've already lost 25lbs. and that's under 3 months, and I couldn't have done it without the support of this gym. Though I am pretty quiet in class everyone there probably has no clue how much they've inspired me to keep going. So with that said I am showing you a picture below of my before and after, the before is a picture I literally took the first week I started, and the after is after my working out there for 3 months. To be clear I started with the 6-week challenge so I was only working out 3 days a week, but when that 6 weeks ended I started working out 5 days a week. Oh, and I will not lie to you I pigged out for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years, BUT because Id started to tone some of my body the Holiday bulge didn't hit me as hard this year as it normally does. What I can see is that there are clothes I wasn't able to wear for YEARS that I can wear now. Shirts that wouldn't button below the first button on my neck are now fully buttoning all the way down on me, and the buttons aren't screaming for help either, they are resting comfortably on my thinning frame. So I'm psyched to see what I'm able to achieve here at Peak 5 because if this is what I can see after only 3 months, I can't wait to see what I look like in a year. I hope this helps someone to make the move to join in with a wonderful group of people, who want to win, and want to see you win. I know this sounds cliche' but truthfully If I can do it, you can do it, I just didn't want to do it, and forced myself to do it. Was it easy? NOPE. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY, and there's no going back from it now, it feels too good, to be getting better. So welcome to the new decade folks we're officially in the 2020s so let's get healthy.  This message was brought to you by a former fat guy who has found his wings to take flight.",RhUOx0WUzPU_3UnmQ0ODgQ,James W.,90029

Peak 5 happens to be around the corner from my apartment, and it has the best reviews of any gym I've ever read. I was intimidated at first, but Pete and the other coaches have made the gym extremely welcoming. They're down-to-earth, knowledgeable, and kind, and they've been extremely helpful in modulating my workouts for my level. And while the last two months have been physically exhausting, it's been very fun, too. I also like that there's very little of that CrossFit cult stuff, and the members exhibit zero attitude.

I've enjoyed the coaches and have no complaints. There really is no point in getting healthier, for whatever reason, if you're not going to change the unhealthy aspects of your current nutrition habits.  After seeing what it takes to burn off calories and the challenging workouts, I eliminated most sugar/carbs and began running - none of it was easy in the beginning - baby steps. I saw immediate results.  Go at your own pace, I still have to push myself to go to class but always leave feeling invigorated and glad I went.  Especially when you start seeing the results (I fit back in these pants - yes!). In the beginning your body is going to be in so much pain but it's only for about a month until your body acclimates to the workouts - get rest. *Soak in epson salt baths and whatever menthol creams you may need for your knees and other parts of your body that need oil (tin man). What I absolutely noticed was when taking morning classes, I would go to work and a surge of good energy remained for most of the day - I then realized it's body chemicals:dopamine, endorphins,seratonin - I was on a feel good high and you will get addicted - let me take my ass back to Crossfit (once the stress of real life takes effect)!

Ricky Jaime got me going and kept me hyped, what a crazy intense class. So, I got in about 5 minutes late (traffic sucks when you're coming from the valley) and was greeted by BIG smiles behind the counter. I made a dumb joke about how I thought that this was a yoga class... um yeah, they assured me it was not. So I walk in and the workout has already started, pitch black room and all that is lit up is the lights inside the spinning water of the row machine... so I told myself ""get to rowing' girl!!"" And then I died. HA! I went crazy and all out for the entire 45 minutes, I was not prepared whatsoever. So, we would row, with as much speed as we could perpetuate, for a slow 15 second count, and then we'd hop off and do sets with the wall straps, stretch and stop to drink if needed, and then get back on that row machine! Towards the end of the session, we did push ups and crunches on the mats in place of the wall exercises... and then hopped back on that machine! I felt so good after, so good! Like, mostly dead, but good. I swear more than I have sweat from any other workout, ever.

I was able to hit my challenge goal of 20lb and then some. Honestly, the awesome people running and working at this gym made it feel easy. Each trainer teaches class in an upbeat and positive way and encourages you to push yourself just beyond what you thought your limits were while providing key tips to help you maximize each exercise. The culture throughout the place is very supportive overall - It begins with the trainers and all the staff but carries through to the clientele. It felt great to know I wasn't alone in reaching for my goals and to be able to celebrate the smaller, daily victories (mine or others') with those around me. Def have to mention the cafe up front, which provides delicious and healthy options that can work into whatever workout-friendly meal plan you've got going on.

Came on a Thursday evening for a HIIT class and managed to work up a good sweat. I can't really pinpoint what it was but Jason just didn't seem to have the energy I was expecting going into this class. While he was explaining all the exercises he seemed almost confused, which I think contributed to why I was a little lost during the first round. Also. considering the relatively small size of the class and that it was my first time here, I was hoping to introduce myself but we kinda just jumped straight into the class. Given that Jason seemed pretty familiar with a lot of the faces I did feel a little excluded. Overall, the class was good because structurally it was a good full-body workout. And if I had a question about a specific exercise Jason was helpful. I guess I was looking for an exceptionally high energy instructor to really push me to work harder, but I didn't exactly get that when I visited.",c3BsTDM1Cpwj_L_NNZui3A,Josh B.,90046

The coaches went and still does go over and beyond to reassure you're getting most out of your membership. One big plus for me was that they definitely keep you accountable! For instance, one of the coaches when I first started would text me if I didn't show up on a day I usually come. They did not have to do that but that extra step made a huge difference in me, wanting to be consistent. After a year and half I'm the healthy I've been in awhile and I've maintained that weight loss. I lost in total 21 lbs and gained a lot of valuable foundation to maintain that weight loss.

After six weeks I saw myself forming abs, and a nicer butt. I loved it so much I have made crossfit part of my life style. The six week challenge included workouts that were pre planned for you. They also really mix up the exercises so you never get bored. We also had a nutritionist come in, Annora, on Sundays to educate us on healthy eating habits. One of the things I like about learning from Annora was the mental aspect to eating healthy and being healthy about eating. Being part of this crossfit team has been a lot of fun because I made some friends and I pushed myself a lot during my workouts. All the trainers are so helpful, and after every run we did they were always there to give you high fives after your runs, and workouts.

When it comes to the actual weight training, he's definitely pushing me, but in a supportive way. I was initially worried that doing the same routines would bore me, but Geoff changes it up enough for me to not check out by having me pay attention more to my form, adding more weight to make it more challenging, and then surprising me with a new thing to do.",a6-8MDdefdwcdex4oYxd1A,Lennar M.,90025

Then work really started to take off i really found myself stuck behind a desk first one year went by then two then three before i knew it a decade went by. I lost the will and motivation to want to train. I know I'm not alone hear. I felt like crap became toxic and gained a bunch of weight feeling depressed just lack the will to interact became withdrawn really started to hate my life and what i allowed to happen. I always dabbled with research about fitness and even tried to kick start myself back into active life style. Boxed did cross-fit but then would get injured have to recover get better go get injured recover repeat repeat repeat until i just stopped altogether. Another year went by then two back to feeling sorry for myself didn't like where things had fallen once again. Then one day Browsing the internet came across and article about Ultimate Performance. they had tons of Before and afters photos . Never has any Gym shown such a record of success. I figured i need to try something so i set up an appointment meet with staff which by the way they are awesome.

He's amazing at cueing proper form, and keeping the energy up throughout the challenging work! Love this studio, and I've been to my fair share of group fitness classes in LA. It is a hard workout in a space that emphasizes proper form (rare in LA- usually it's just go go go!). Felt great after, but I'm going to be sore tomorrow.
